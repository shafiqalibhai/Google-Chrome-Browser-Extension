<H2 CLASS="western">Introduction</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">What does it do?</H3>
<P CLASS="western">This tutorial will introduce you to the basic
principles of TYPO3. You will get started hands-on with your first
TYPO3 website.  After this tutorial you will have an idea of the
capabilities of TYPO3 as well as complexities involved. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tutorial will require you to install some
software. If you just want to get a feel for TYPO3 before installing
anything you should take a look at the demo-site at
<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://demo.typo3.com/">http://demo.typo3.com/</A>
first.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Professional creation of templates and development
with TYPO3 in general are <I>not</I> covered in detail in this
document! That is done in the next tutorial - <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=442&amp;cHash=d442c244f7">Modern
Template Building, Part 1</A> - and basically the remaining body of
literature on TYPO3 development!</P>

<P CLASS="western">The example website in this tutorial is for a
football club called &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot;. The website looks like
this:</P>

	<LI><P CLASS="western">Edit and create pages, content on pages,
	insert images, tables, bullet lists, links etc.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Create password protected areas of the

<P CLASS="western">If you would rather like to read this tutorial as
a <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/fileadmin/dl/tutorials/quickstart.pdf">PDF
document you can download it here</A>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Translator's notice</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Not many of the documents which are meant for
TYPO3 developers are available in other languages. There are
different reasons for that. One important reason is that the common
language we use within the international developer community, is
English. Even if an open source community like ours could manage
maintaining the big amount of documentation which exists for TYPO3 in
several languages, the developers soon wouldn't speak about the same,
just because of their different languages. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">That's why basically all documents dealing with
the development of TYPO3 will be available only in English. And the
central point for discussions will for the next period most likely be
the English mailing list.</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tutorial is meant to help you <I>getting
started</I> with TYPO3. For this reason we decided to allow the
translation of it into other languages. In the localized version of
this document please don't wonder about the use of English words
mixed in: If you want to understand the English documents later on,
it's important to get used to the English termini from the very
start.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Dedicated to</H3>
<P CLASS="western">I  would like to dedicate this tutorial to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">All my TYPO3 friends I have got from the
	snowboard tours - meeting you and realizing there are people behind
	the emails is worth it all.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">My most lovely wife, Rie - thanks for all the
	patience and love you have shown, even when the work load needed
	your shoulders as well.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">My savior, Jesus Christ - thanks for creating
	such a wonderful world with all its potential for us human beings to
	create beautiful things as well. Thanks for being the way and the
	truth and the life.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Installation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">TYPO3 is a web-application based on PHP4 and
MySQL. Therefore you must have access to a web server with PHP and
MySQL in order to try out TYPO3. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you already have access to a web server with
PHP4 and MySQL then you can select &quot;Installation A&quot; below;
you will have to download a zip-file, unzip it on your server space
and that's it.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you do not have a web server then select
&quot;Installation B&quot; - that is a Windows Installer that
installs all needed software (Apache, MySQL, PHP4 and TYPO3) in a few
clicks - and removes it all afterward if you like to.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Installation A - zip-file</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">1: Download the QuickStart Package</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Go to typo3.org to <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1274.0.html">get
the quickstart.zip </A><A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1274.0.html"><I>package</I></A><A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1274.0.html">.</A></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">2: Unzip package on your web server</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In my case I have a local Apache web server
running. The web root directory is in c:\apache\htdocs - this is
where I'll unzip the package (this is the same location as the
installer package uses).</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1bbf356a.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=73 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">3: Start your webbrowser</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Go the the URL where you unzipped the files:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1a89aab.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=374 HEIGHT=121 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In a brief second you will see this screen:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1d3ee54e.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=328 HEIGHT=135 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">... but quickly you are directed to this screen
(below) where you enter your database username, password and
localhost. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">4: Database username, password and host</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In my case no username and password were needed
(which is of course not very secure :-)</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4079f504.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=393 HEIGHT=309 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">5: Create database</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Then enter a name for your database. In my case
&quot;t3_quickstart&quot; is selected. I always prefix TYPO3
databases with &quot;t3_&quot;. That is nice if you have many
different databases.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6547487a.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=449 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">6: Dump database content</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The final step is to &quot;dump&quot; some content
into the database. A new database like &quot;t3_quickstart&quot;
contains nothing of course - this step will put in a lot of
information for our example website, e.g. users, pages, content etc.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5a9f318a.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=439 HEIGHT=218 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">If you see the &quot;GO&quot;
become red now</SPAN> it means you are finished! Congratulations!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Well, let’s check if it actually works now.
There are two things to check - the <I>frontend</I> and the <I>backend</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">(Read on in the section &quot;<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=491&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1395&amp;cHash=0d7f95ad82">Check
the installation</A>&quot; after the &quot;Installation B&quot;
chapter.)</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Installation B - Windows Installer Package</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Go to the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1274.0.html">package
page on typo3.org</A> and download the &quot;WAMP - quickstart&quot;
Installer (thanks Ingmar) which contains the QuickStart website. The
download is 28+ MB but worth it in terms of the trouble you save
compared to installing on existing webservers - at least if you are
here for a quick'n'dirty test of TYPO3!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">1: Download installer</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Click the download link, go for a bag of sweet
candy in your nearby store and when you are back you will see this:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">Click the &quot;Open&quot; button to start the
installer.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">2: Agree with the GPL License!</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Then press &quot;Agree&quot; on the license
screen. Notice that for once you can (probably) do this with perfect
conscience since the GPL actually allows you to receive, copy, modify
and distribute TYPO3 freely as long as the same rights to do so is
passed on to the next recipient. The basic principle of GPL is that
software <I>stays</I> free! (And that includes any modification /
addition you make to TYPO3!). So just pass it on to your friends!</P>

otherwise the web server will just shut down again. You can minimize
it of course.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next time you start your computer and want to work
with TYPO3 you will have to <I>start the web server again</I>. MySQL
has been installed as a service (has a little traffic-light icon in

<P CLASS="western">If you see this it means you are finished!
Congratulations!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Well, let’s check if it actually works now.
There are two things to check - the <I>frontend</I> and the <I>backend</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">(Read on in the next section &quot;Check the
installation&quot;)</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Check the installation</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">Check the frontend</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The <I>frontend</I> is a term for the website
TYPO3 generates. This is what your visitors will see - this is the
<I>product</I> TYPO3 creates for you! The frontend should now be
visible at the original URL you typed in (In my case it was
http://localhost/quickstart/). You should see this screen after a
second:</P>

<P CLASS="western">You can click the links in the menu to the left to
explore the pages on the website.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Check the backend</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The <I>backend</I> is a term for the
<I>administration interface</I> you use to manage the website content
in the <I>frontend</I>. In the backend you edit and create pages and
content. The backend is normally accessible from the subdirectory
&quot;typo3/&quot; of the installation. So try to type in &quot;typo3/&quot;
after &quot;.../quickstart/&quot;:</P>

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, for the second time - and this time I really
mean it - <I>congratulations!</I> TYPO3 has been installed, the
frontend is working and the backend has let you in. You are ready to
play around.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">More details about installation</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Please note that this stepwise guide to
installation only took you through the most basic requirements and is
designed to get you quickly started for testing and development
purposes. When you need to install and configure TYPO3 for production
environments or serious development you must read and understand the
background issues described in the document <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=265&amp;cHash=ac6dd4f2a2">Installation
and Upgrade of Typo3</A>. Further there is a <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1411.0.html">mailing
list </A>and <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1423.0.html">archive</A>
for seeking help on installation issues.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">General
principles</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Backend and frontend</H3>
<P CLASS="western">As you know from the installation TYPO3 is divided
into two areas - the backend and the frontend. While the frontend is
for everyone out there on the web - it is the website TYPO3 produces
- only you and your content contributers are allowed access to the
backend - the administration of the website. A username and password
is always required. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Backend modules</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In the backend there are a lot of modules in the
menu to the left. When you want to edit and create pages, select the
&quot;Page&quot; module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m4a0f0105.png" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=107 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Each module has it's own content to display. Since
you are the administrator you have access to all modules. But there
are other &quot;normal&quot; users - they have access only to the
modules you have selected for them!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to click the various modules in the menu and
see how the content frame changes.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Pagetree</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The header &quot;Web&quot; in the menu is called a
&quot;main module&quot; and all the modules listed under it are &quot;sub
modules&quot;. All modules under the &quot;Web&quot; main module will
show a dual view in the content frame - the <I>page tree</I> (left
#1) and the module content in relation to a page from the page tree
(right #2).</P>
<P CLASS="western">The page tree can be expanded by clicking the
plus/minus icons (#3). This works exactly like folders on your own
computer. Actually you can think about the page tree as a <I>directory
structure</I> where web pages are organized in a hierarchy with main
pages, sub pages and sub-sub pages etc.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4f3d43fc.png" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=488 HEIGHT=309 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Clicking titles and icons</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The next important thing to know about the page
tree is that you can click both the <I>page icon</I> and the <I>page
title</I> - and that it makes a difference!</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you click the <I>page title</I> you will see
the current module display some content in the right frame:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_48dfa5f.png" NAME="Graphic17" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=322 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In this case the &quot;Page&quot; module is the
active one and then you will see the content on the page shown in the
right frame. From here you can edit it etc. We will soon discuss
that.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you click the <I>page icon</I> instead of the
title a little <I>context sensitive menu</I> appears. This is
sometimes referred to as a click menu:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_272c2a84.png" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=214 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><I>Notice: If you use older browsers the menu will
not appear close to the icon but in the top frame of the backend
instead. Further, be patient - the menu might take a few seconds to
appear!</I></P>
<P CLASS="western">In the context menu you can select options that
are <I>related to</I> this page! For most of them it is obvious what
they do - try to play around with them if you like. For this example
I have selected &quot;Show&quot; which means I will have another
browser window opened and see <I>this specific page</I> shown in the
frontend:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mf03cfe1.png" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=429 HEIGHT=327 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice how this page was shown in the new window
by calling the script &quot;.../quickstart/index.php?<B>id=13</B>&quot;
(#1). In TYPO3 every page is stored in the database (in a table
called &quot;pages&quot;) and each of these page-&quot;records&quot;
has a unique number (uid). Here the parameter called &quot;id&quot;
was set to the value &quot;13&quot; - and apparently that must have
been the uid-number of the page called &quot;This week&quot; in the
page tree!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Further you can see the page content (#2) is the
same as you saw (if you noticed) in the left frame of the Page module
when you clicked the title! We will return to that.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then notice the page header (#3) - here the title
of the page we viewed is shown (&quot;This week&quot;) but the parent
page in the page tree - &quot;Results&quot; - is shown as well. This
communicates the logic of the page tree - that the &quot;This week&quot;
page is a <I>sub page</I> (child) to the &quot;Results&quot; page
(parent). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The final thing to notice is the menu in the left
frame. This clearly reflects the hierarchy we also saw in the page
tree:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_62e1455e.png" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=355 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The technical implementation of parents and
children</H4>
<P CLASS="western">This is for people who wants to understand how the
tree structure works technically in the database:</P>
<P CLASS="western">Technically the relationship between a page and
sub pages is established by the field called &quot;pid&quot; (parent
id/page id) in the pages table in the database - the &quot;pid&quot;
field of &quot;This week&quot; page will contain the &quot;uid&quot;
value of the page called &quot;Results&quot;.</P>
<P CLASS="western">By holding the mouse over the page icon of the
&quot;Results&quot; page for a second you will see this title-text
appear:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m55b9cda0.png" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tells us that the page &quot;Results&quot;
has the uid-number &quot;4&quot;. We know that the &quot;This week&quot;
page had the uid &quot;13&quot; (and the pages &quot;Last week&quot;
and &quot;Report results&quot; have uids 12 and 11). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If we go to the module &quot;phpMyAdmin&quot; and
browse the &quot;pages&quot; table (which contain all the page header
records) we should be able to see this relationship quite easily:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m8b55308.png" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=583 HEIGHT=433 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Clearly the three subpages to &quot;Results&quot;
has their &quot;pid&quot; field values set to &quot;4&quot; - as we
would expect.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now you have learned that 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Pages (and all other records by the way!) are
	uniquely identified by their &quot;uid&quot; field number -
	sometimes referred to as the &quot;id&quot;</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Pages (and all other records!) point to their
	parent page by their &quot;pid&quot; field number.</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Special pages</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Maybe you noticed that some pages from the page
tree was not shown in the menu of the website? Well, the pages were
these:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m786831de.png" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=92 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Not in menu</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Log in&quot; page (#1) was not shown
because the page type was set to &quot;Not in menu&quot;. This is
useful if you want to create a page which should not appear as a menu
item. Still you can access the page by creating a link to it manually
- or just type in its id-number in the URL directly!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Setting the &quot;Not in menu&quot; mode for a
page is done by editing the page header:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m62a72394.png" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=182 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m41ef5f61.png" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=371 HEIGHT=219 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Access restricted page</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Team pages&quot; page (#2) is not
visible because it has been access restricted. This means it will
only be shown when a frontend user has logged in. This is covered
later in this tutorial. But the short story is that you edit the page
header and select the user group you want to allow access for:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m77343931.png" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">sysFolders - what is that?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Finally the two so-called &quot;sysFolders&quot;
are not displayed (#3). You create a sysFolder like you created the
&quot;Not in menu&quot; page - simply select &quot;sysFolder&quot; as
the page type (see previously).</P>
<P CLASS="western">But what is it? Well, by default pages created in
TYPO3 are meant to contain web page content. They appear in the menu
and can have a title. 95% of all pages are used like that. But pages
can also serve as simple containers of database elements that are not
meant to be content on a visible web page. This is what sysFolders
are for! Use them just like you use folders on your computer's file
system to store different files in an organized manner! In the same
way sysFolders are &quot;folders&quot; that nicely organize database
elements inside TYPO3!</P>
<P CLASS="western">In this specific case the sysFolder &quot;Users&quot;
contains the website users that can log in to the website (more about
that later on). You can view the content of the sysFolder by using
the &quot;List&quot; module (that is the &quot;Explorer&quot; inside
of TYPO3...):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m27f7b94c.png" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=291 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Shortcuts</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Apart from the page types that did not show up in
the menu there are also two mysterious pages with a &quot;shortcut
icon&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1a095182.png" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=177 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">A shortcut is a neat feature if you have a page
(empty, without content on) that should simply jump to another page
directly! That is very convenient if you still want the link to
appear in the menu for instance!</P>
<P CLASS="western">In our case the &quot;Home&quot; page jumps to the
frontpage and the &quot;Results&quot; page to &quot;This week&quot;.
Try it yourself!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_471ff117.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You create shortcuts by editing the page type. For
the &quot;Home&quot; page it looks like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m71830ad1.png" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=413 HEIGHT=274 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You use the Element Browser to select a page to
refer to. The Element Browser is used to create relations between
records and files in TYPO3's editing forms. You can read <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1218.0.html">more
details on the Element Browser here</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">For the page &quot;Results&quot; the shortcut is a
little more fancy - it simply jumps to the first sub page it finds!
That is in our case the &quot;This week&quot; page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m74d1ba06.png" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=616 HEIGHT=299 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Shortcut mode&quot; is a so called
<I>secondary option</I> to the &quot;Shortcut to page&quot; field -
that means the field is only shown (in the <I>palette</I> / top
frame) when you click the &quot;More options...&quot; icon (see
picture above).</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Help at your fingertips!</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, what might all the other interesting page
types do? Well you can find out directly if you just click the little
&quot;?&quot; icon close to the field:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_673716e.png" NAME="Graphic32" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=224 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then a window like this pops up:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m7f524d3a.png" NAME="Graphic33" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=255 HEIGHT=325 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is called <I>Context Sensitive Help</I> and
can be found for almost all elements in TYPO3 where you need some
information about it's function! Use it! It's easy and it's right at
your fingertips when you work inside the system!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Page content 
</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Now we have looked at the page tree, seen how the
page tree is reflected in the website menu hierarchy and how pages
can be viewed etc.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The next question is - how is content on a page
organized? Let’s take a look at the &quot;This week&quot; page
again:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mb227113.png" NAME="Graphic34" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=610 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The page content on that page is made up of three
<I>page content elements</I> - here numbered 1-3. And because each
content element can have a different type you can create pages with
very flexible structures! In this case the page consists of a &quot;Text&quot;
type content element, then two &quot;Table&quot; type content
elements.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Side note: TYPO3 - an element based CMS</H4>
<P CLASS="western">This method of constructing pages is a very
foundational concept in most websites made by TYPO3. The method of
putting together pages of content elements is also known from other
CMSs today. This makes TYPO3 an &quot;element-based&quot; CMS. It
gives a lot of flexibility but <I>yet</I> it makes the pages
consistently designed - as it is one of the objectives of a CMS! The
alternative method is a more fixed approach where a page has a fixed
number of content areas - one for header, bodytext and image for
instance. TYPO3 can do that as well (it can allow for anything you
like!) but most likely you don't want that in the end. If you have
some questions to professional implementation techniques for
template-designs, content elements etc. please look in the tutorials
called &quot;Modern Template Building&quot;, <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=442&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1273&amp;cHash=e678dd49eb">Part
1</A> and <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=490&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1289&amp;cHash=049218db2e">Part2+3</A>.
For now, please note that these documents are on a far higher level
than this one and you should take one step at a time if you are a
beginner to TYPO3.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Order of content elements</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Well, back to the content elements on the webpage;
take a look at them in the backend:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1fbd62f.png" NAME="Graphic35" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=479 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Make a comparison of the frontend and backend
views now. Can you see how the elements from the backend are clearly
the same as those in the frontend?</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to rearrange a backend element by moving it up
in the order:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m516cae3e.png" NAME="Graphic36" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=362 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This will yield this order from the top:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_45ce5962.png" NAME="Graphic37" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=452 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">... and on the webpage it looks like:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5947becd.png" NAME="Graphic38" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=469 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Parent page of content elements</H4>
<P CLASS="western">This is for people who want to understand the
technical side of content elements and pages:</P>
<P CLASS="western">Remember how the page records had a field, &quot;pid&quot;,
which pointed to their parent page? Well, page content elements
(records) - and any other database record configured for the TYPO3
backend - have that as well. Looking in the phpMyAdmin module again
we see that the page content elements (table: &quot;tt_content&quot;)
with uids 18-20 all point to the page uid &quot;13&quot; - the uid of
the &quot;This week&quot; page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5bfb3852.png" NAME="Graphic39" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=282 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">It's that logical!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Edit and create
pages and content</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Edit page</H3>
<P CLASS="western">We know that pages store their visible content in
<I>page content elements</I>. So editing a page must be editing <I>page
content elements</I>! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">It's really easy to edit page content in TYPO3.
Just select the Page module (#1), click the page title of the page
you want to edit (#2) and in the &quot;Columns&quot; view (#3) you
click the edit icon (#4) of the page content element you wish to
change:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3f23a2ed.png" NAME="Graphic40" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=196 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This brings up this edit form:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_me03e2c4.png" NAME="Graphic41" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=508 HEIGHT=424 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">First of all the field &quot;Type:&quot; (#1)
tells you the <I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">type</SPAN></I>
of page content element! In this case &quot;Text&quot;. It could also
be &quot;Table&quot; (like you saw earlier) or &quot;Image&quot; or
&quot;Text w/Image&quot; etc. See for yourself! Each content element
type has it's own look and fields for content and by inserting
different elements you can achieve great diversity on your website.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Header&quot; field (#2) contains the
header and the &quot;Text&quot; field (#3) the bodytext. On the
webpage this corresponds to:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_f2ef3aa.png" NAME="Graphic42" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=489 HEIGHT=332 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to change the header field value and press
&quot;Save document and view page&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5a3246ef.png" NAME="Graphic43" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=341 HEIGHT=193 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Because you saved by the bottom &quot;Save
document and view page&quot; you will automatically have the frontend
window shown to you in a few seconds:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_217f4498.png" NAME="Graphic44" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=301 HEIGHT=65 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">What TYPO3 did was to send the change to the
webserver, update the database with the new information, then clear
the page cache and regenerate the page - the change is <I>instantly</I>
online and people surfing on your website will now see the new header
instead of the old! It's that easy and fast to maintain webpages with
TYPO3!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Tip: Another way to activate page edit</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Instead of clicking your way from the &quot;Page&quot;
module to the page tree etc. there is also an &quot;Edit item&quot;
in the click menu which also brings up the Page module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_38800811.png" NAME="Graphic45" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=247 HEIGHT=76 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Tip: QuickEdit - save a mouseclick...</H4>
<P CLASS="western">If you want fast access to your page content
elements you can change the Page module view to &quot;QuickEdit&quot;
instead of &quot;Columns&quot; - then the first content element on a
page is shown right away:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m557e3027.png" NAME="Graphic46" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=185 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">New page</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Creating new pages is very easy. Since pages are
always organized in the hierarchy of the page tree you will have to
settle for a position of the page first. Of course you can change
that later if you like. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">To create a new page use the Page module in
Columns view to start the &quot;New page&quot; wizard - that will
help you to find the right spot to insert the page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_me9dc29a.png" NAME="Graphic47" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=158 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then a <I>position selector</I> will appear. By
this you can click the right position for the page visually:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2d03568a.png" NAME="Graphic48" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=354 HEIGHT=306 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally a form for a new page is shown and you can
enter a title for the page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1e0235cb.png" NAME="Graphic49" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=191 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save document and close.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now the page tree should be updated:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4933dbeb.png" NAME="Graphic50" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=76 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And if you click the page icon of the new page
&quot;Topscorer&quot; you should see that the menu in the frontend
has been automatically updated as well!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m19909e6b.png" NAME="Graphic51" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=382 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that the page is referred to by the id &quot;27&quot;
- so the new page automatically got the &quot;uid&quot; number &quot;27&quot;
assigned during creation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The page is still blank - we need to create some
page content elements on the page!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Creating page content elements</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In the Page module, click the <I>page title</I> of
&quot;Topscorer&quot; in the page tree and then the button &quot;Create
page content&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_ebdcedd.png" NAME="Graphic52" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=159 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Immediately you will see a nice form like this
(below). This allows you to select a page content element <I>type</I>
- as I said earlier different content element types create different
kinds of content on the web page.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Let’s create &quot;Text with image below&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2b11c600.png" NAME="Graphic53" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=486 HEIGHT=238 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Right away we get this form. Now enter some dummy
content and select an image from your hard drive (find a small jpeg
image):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_64961123.png" NAME="Graphic56" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=576 HEIGHT=355 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Press the &quot;Save document&quot; button. Now
the image is uploaded to the webserver and attached to the new page
content element. This should look like this if everything went fine:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7e5b4f65.png" NAME="Graphic55" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=522 HEIGHT=107 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">On the web page the page now looks like this:</P>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7793af9d.png" NAME="Graphic54" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=361 HEIGHT=183 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Inserting another content element</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Back in the Page module the new content element is
clearly shown:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2cd78f70.png" NAME="Graphic58" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=501 HEIGHT=203 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Notice: Missing the thumbnail?</B> If you don't
see a nice little thumbnail of the image here TYPO3 is probably not
configured correctly for using ImageMagick. This is most likely the
case if you <I>did not</I> use the Windows Installer Package (see the
<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=491&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1331&amp;cHash=70e842790c">install

install mailing list archives</A>. You <I>can</I> complete this
tutorial without these features working though.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Click the button &quot;New content&quot; to create
another content element with a bullet list after this one:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_658b091.png" NAME="Graphic63" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=48 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This time we have to make another selection in
addition to the first one - where should the element go? Before or
after the <I>current </I>page content element?</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m731967d5.png" NAME="Graphic62" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=436 HEIGHT=141 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">We insert it after the current. Now there is only
the content of the bullet list left:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_ma3a63b9.png" NAME="Graphic61" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=189 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that the &quot;Type&quot; was preset to
&quot;Bullet list&quot; - this could have been selected manually
instead. And you can <I>change </I>it as you like later on! If you
want to know about the various content element types available
remember the little &quot;?&quot; icon - h<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">elp
is right at your fingertips!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now the page has two content elements, a &quot;Text
w/Image&quot; type and a &quot;Bullet list&quot; type - in that
order:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m348cc381.png" NAME="Graphic59" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=329 HEIGHT=138 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the Page module this looks like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5d9d2e37.png" NAME="Graphic60" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=466 HEIGHT=236 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Management of content elements</H4>
<P CLASS="western">You just used the &quot;New content&quot; wizard
to create new page content. However the wizards in TYPO3 just makes a
common task quick and simple by taking you straight to the important
options. But under the hood all the features can be selected, fine
tuned and controlled manually. You will realize this as you work with
TYPO3. Take your time to explore the buttons and options. There are
many possibilities and you can only get to know them if you take time
to play around!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Here are a few examples of interface features you
can try:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1b79a06e.png" NAME="Graphic64" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=512 HEIGHT=273 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Creating a new page content element <I>after</I>
the first one can be done by this button (#1). You will by default
get a &quot;Text&quot; type element - just change the type to
whatever you want. The button &quot;Move record down&quot; (#2) can
be used to change the order between many content elements on the same
page/column. Likewise you can use the &quot;Copy&quot;, &quot;Cut&quot;
and &quot;Paste after&quot; features from the click menu (#8) - they
even allow you to make copies and move elements to other pages! The
&quot;Hide/Unhide&quot; button (#3) is a quick way to change the
&quot;Hide&quot; flag of the element and the garbage can (#4) allows
you to delete the element totally (actually it can be restored if you
do it by accident). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you need to edit only the content in the body
text area of the content element it's a nice feature to click the
&quot;Edit in Rich Text Editor&quot; button (#5). This will bring up
a &quot;full-screen&quot; window for editing the text - nice if there
is a lot of text! Clicking the icon of the page content elements will
as usual bring up a context sensitive menu for the element. Finally
you can actually edit not only one page content element at a time but
<I>two (or more) </I>by clicking the Column-edit icon (#7).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Move page</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Moving a page is also very easy with the wizard
available from the Page module. Let’s say we want to move the page
&quot;Topscorer&quot; from its current position to right after
&quot;Sitemap&quot; in the &quot;Home&quot; section:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1f69e3a1.png" NAME="Graphic65" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=463 HEIGHT=134 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then you will see a branch of the page tree and by
clicking the top page you go up one level:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m431bfe10.png" NAME="Graphic66" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=154 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And by a single, logical click you have moved the
page to the new position:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_18aedee1.png" NAME="Graphic67" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=180 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The page tree is instantly updated:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6035a3f5.png" NAME="Graphic68" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=249 HEIGHT=139 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Using the cut'n'paste feature to move a page</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Move page&quot; wizard is absolutely the
most intuitive tool for beginners. However when you want to get the
bigger picture of how to move elements - including pages - around in
TYPO3 you should use the internal clipboard. It works pretty much
like you know it from windows: You right-click a document, select
&quot;Cut&quot;, then right click the folder where you want to insert
it and select &quot;Paste&quot;. The same principle is implemented in
TYPO3. Let’s use that to move the page back again:</P>
<P CLASS="western">&quot;Cut&quot; the page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_a8f4263.png" NAME="Graphic69" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=245 HEIGHT=144 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">&quot;Paste after&quot; the &quot;Report results&quot;
page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_35e2c81e.png" NAME="Graphic70" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=165 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Answer &quot;OK&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3661285b.png" NAME="Graphic71" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=278 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">That's it! The page is back where it belongs:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6f0db570.png" NAME="Graphic72" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=111 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Background: Watch out  - consistent concepts on
board!</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that the same principles of copy/cut/paste
can be used with not only pages but page content elements as well -
well, in fact any database element or file that TYPO3 manages is
subject to this functionality! This is a great example of how TYPO3
uses the same concepts consistently and throughout the system - so
once you have learned a feature, a lot of other features make sense
to you as well! If you open your eyes to it you will have many of
those &quot;Aha!&quot; experiences when you see how things are
designed to fit together.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Visibility settings  - hiding pages, timing
appearance etc.</H3>
<P CLASS="western">A feature you will find for many elements - in
particular pages and page content elements - is the publishing
control fields or <I>visibility settings</I>. They look like this for
pages:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m435c5ca4.png" NAME="Graphic112" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=531 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">For content elements they are in the bottom of the
form:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1be0e6e2.png" NAME="Graphic113" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=65 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Hiding a page</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Try to check the &quot;Hide page&quot; flag:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4e80e1f2.png" NAME="Graphic114" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=73 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Nice as it is the page icon even becomes dimmed in
grayscale and has a little red cross over it - it's now hidden!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_44911b25.png" NAME="Graphic115" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=174 HEIGHT=75 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This means you cannot see the page in the
frontend:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m21cfa47a.png" NAME="Graphic116" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=58 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">(Very important that you select &quot;Show&quot;
for the &quot;Last week&quot; page!)</P>
<P CLASS="western">See... no &quot;This week&quot; page there!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m769250c6.png" NAME="Graphic117" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=63 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">However if you actually go directly to the &quot;This
week&quot; page you WILL see it anyway:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_15d67d51.png" NAME="Graphic118" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=354 HEIGHT=78 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">... <I>because </I>when you are logged in as a
backend user hidden pages can be <I>previewed </I>- as indicated with
the little box in the bottom of the page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m10af8f6d.png" NAME="Graphic119" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=248 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">But! - that is for <I>your</I> eyes only. No one
out in the world can see the page before you un-hide it again!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Timing pages and content elements</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Hiding pages and content element is probably the
most typical kind of visibility setting. It's so common that it
actually has its own item in the context menus:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7c93f2c0.png" NAME="Graphic120" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=173 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">But you can also determine when a page should go
online - which date! For instance try to enter the code &quot;d+10&quot;
in the &quot;Start  time&quot; field:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m8e2e18a.png" NAME="Graphic121" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=369 HEIGHT=45 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Automatically the date is set to the current date
plus 10 days! If you save the page and hold the mouse over the icon
you can also see this setting reflected:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1ab057cb.png" NAME="Graphic122" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=194 HEIGHT=61 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And guess what - this page is currently <I>not
visible</I> and will <I>automatically be visible</I> the 11th of
April year 2003, 10 days later! That's how easy it is to control
publishing of information based on Start times. The same principles
work for the &quot;Stop&quot; field of course. And for page content
elements, news elements, guest book elements - you name it. Same
principle - many places - easy to understand.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Rich Text Editing: Bold, Italics, Bullet lists,
Insert images</H3>
<P CLASS="western">When you are working with the body text on your
pages you can use the same kind of formatting options as you are used
to from your word processor. If you are using TYPO3 with Microsoft
Internet Explorer you have access to a Rich Text Editor (RTE) for the
body text field. &quot;Rich Text&quot; means that you can apply
formatting to the text in addition to just writing it.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to edit the body text field of the new
&quot;Topscorer&quot; page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_53f0c1f2.png" NAME="Graphic73" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=322 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">By a using the buttons &quot;B&quot;, &quot;I&quot;,

<H4 CLASS="western">Considerations about &quot;rich content&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see - this gives you two choices: a)
Will you create bullet lists &quot;inline&quot; in the body text
fields or b) will you create them by separate content elements? You
can mix the two approaches. Personally I find it absolutely most
convenient to just create bullet lists inside of body text fields
with the RTE - but if someone with Microsoft Internet Explorer is
going to edit the list it's usually very hard! And you might have
&quot;political reasons&quot; for not inserting bullet lists in body
text (keeping the body text &quot;clean&quot;).</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The RTE in more details</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The Rich Text Editor may be very easy to use, but
it also poses a lot of technical challenges when you investigate the
details. There is <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=214&amp;cHash=c28ad85bbf">extensive
documentation available for the RTE</A>. Read more <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1217.0.html">in-depth
about the RTE</A> here and how to configure it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Make links</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Hyperlinks are what glues the internet together
some say. In TYPO3 you already have links automatically made for you
since the sheer creation of pages in the hierarchical structure of
the page tree has generated the menu in the left frame automatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western">But you still might want to link from a piece of
text to another page, a file, another website or an email address,
right?</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is very easy if you use the Rich Text Editor:</P>
<P CLASS="western">Simply mark the text and press the &quot;Insert
Link&quot; icon:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m12d7610b.png" NAME="Graphic79" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=478 HEIGHT=79 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then click the title of the guest book page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7dc426c1.png" NAME="Graphic80" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=442 HEIGHT=194 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">... and the text is linked:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m4b619a22.png" NAME="Graphic81" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=439 HEIGHT=69 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the frontend this will produce a link as you
would expect. Click it and you are taken to the page with the guest
book!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6e34e333.png" NAME="Graphic82" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=283 HEIGHT=87 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Behind the scenes</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Before I told you that it might be a problem to
use the Rich Text Editor if you expect to edit the content in raw
form later on. You can simulate that by editing the whole content
element and selecting the &quot;Disable Rich Text Editor&quot; option
in the bottom of the form (before editing anything):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3eda80a0.png" NAME="Graphic83" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=264 HEIGHT=107 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Text&quot; field will now look like any
ordinary form field:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_md99a4b2.png" NAME="Graphic84" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=465 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">First of all you can see that the link to the
&quot;Guestbook&quot; page was made by a TYPO3-specific tag, &lt;link&gt;,
combined with the page id. This makes it very easy for people <I>without
</I>the RTE to create links as well! This is simple enough to write
by hand. (Note: The <I>internal</I> &quot;&lt;link&gt;&quot; tag is
converted to a proper HTML &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot; tag when the page is
generated).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Apart from that you can see the bullet list has
been converted to a series of lines encapsulated in &lt;typolist&gt;-tags
- also custom TYPO3 tags. These are also converted to a real bullet
list by the template engine when the page is generated later on.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The very first line contains regular HTML-markup
for the bold, italic and underlining plus center alignment of the
whole paragraph.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Other kinds of links?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">You can create links to local files and external
webpages - even links directly to a specific content element on a
page (see the page &quot;Last week&quot; for an example and figure
out how by yourself!).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally links to email addresses can be created as
well of course. Very easy. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, since we have disabled the Rich Text Editor
why not just use the Wizard icon for full-screen editing:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6fe05b92.png" NAME="Graphic85" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=258 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now write a new bullet list item, mark it and
press the &quot;Insert Link&quot; button. Then select &quot;Email&quot;
in the link type menu and enter your email address:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6f40d214.png" NAME="Graphic86" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=455 HEIGHT=109 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The result should be as expected after saving:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_57fe946d.png" NAME="Graphic87" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=48 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"> - a link which opens the user's email client and
makes it ready to write a new email:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_712a3bdd.png" NAME="Graphic88" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=438 HEIGHT=153 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Content element types</H3>
<P CLASS="western">As you already know there are a number of page
content element types available and combining them is the key to
creating diverse web pages so not every single page on your site
looks the same!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3d80be82.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=268 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As a general rule of thumb - the longer down in
the list an element is, the more advanced or rare it is in use. The
absolutely most used element is the Text or Text w/Image element.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Wizards</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that some elements carry with them a little
wizard. For instance try to edit one of the result-lists from the
page &quot;This week&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2fab9dd5.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=52 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Text&quot; field which normally contains
pure body text now contains the table content apparently organized in
some systematic way:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7eda02a6.png" NAME="Graphic91" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=127 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The table is constructed by interpreting each line
in the &quot;Text&quot; field as a <I>table row</I>. Then the
vertical line, | , is used to separate <I>columns</I> from each
other. This is the &quot;low level&quot; way it works and it <I>could</I>
be maintained by hand. But the &quot;Table wizard&quot; would be the
right tool to use for most people (see image above, right). This will
bring up designated form fields and buttons for adding, deleting and
moving table content around. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">For instance adding a new row would be this easy:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m11070fc9.png" NAME="Graphic90" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=547 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then add some content to the row:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m15fb87b6.png" NAME="Graphic89" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=556 HEIGHT=194 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save the content from the Table wizard and back in
the Text field the <I>real, underlying</I> content looks like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m67da3f08.png" NAME="Graphic92" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=105 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">When the web page in the frontend is refreshed we
will see this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1e92bbb2.png" NAME="Graphic93" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=114 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you wonder how the background color could be
changed - read on!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Secondary options - &quot;Palettes&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western">From the dawn of time TYPO3 has held to the
concept of <I>primary</I> and <I>secondary</I> form fields. The
editing forms in TYPO3 contain a lot of fields and can be extended
with even more. But many fields shown at the same time become very
hard to overview for the average user. In particular if you are a
beginner and have lots of new things to keep inside of your head
already.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The concept of primary and secondary fields means
that normally you see <I>only</I> the most important and typically
used form fields (primary). And more detailed options are hidden in
the secondary fields which are shown on request.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Consider this form:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3b4cdf13.png" NAME="Graphic96" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=566 HEIGHT=141 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Three fields shown - easy to overview.</P>
<P CLASS="western">But if you click one of the icons next to the
fields you will find secondary options shown in the <I>palette</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
(top frame)</SPAN>:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7adb4df0.png" NAME="Graphic98" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=148 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">That is very clever - we have many options, lots
of details but they are stowed away until we need them so we don't
get confused.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The downside is when you <I>need </I>one of these
secondary options and can't remember &quot;behind which icon&quot; it
is (or if you use the field a lot) - then it might in itself be
confusing to <I>find</I> them!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Therefore you can activate the option &quot;Show
secondary options&quot; in the bottom of all editing forms:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_23b5b6b2.png" NAME="Graphic97" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=294 HEIGHT=88 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The result is a big - and possibly confusing -
form. But with <I>all</I> options available at once:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m34ddc92a.png" NAME="Graphic95" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=267 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice how each row of options corresponds exactly
to the content of the palette in the top frame if you clicked the
&quot;More options&quot; icon like before!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">So how do we change the background color of the
table? In the secondary options for the &quot;Layout&quot; selector:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m53dcc2d6.png" NAME="Graphic99" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=442 HEIGHT=182 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><I>(The label &quot;Color 2&quot; refers to the
color with that name configured in the website template.)</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Frontend editing</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The final note on editing pages is the frontend
edit facility. I'm sorry that there are so many ways to do the same
thing. In time you will appreciate this since you will find out what
you like best and you can accomplish more work in less time because
TYPO3 offers these features.</P>
<P CLASS="western">But frontend editing is not just a new button - it
might actually be a revolution to the way you or your content
contributers can work with the system.</P>
<P CLASS="western">You have probably noticed the small edit-icons
that have appeared on the web page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7de371ec.png" NAME="Graphic105" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=495 HEIGHT=224 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">Try to click one of them:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1babd244.png" NAME="Graphic106" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=246 HEIGHT=65 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Instantly you are taken to a form where only the
header field and other relevant information can be edited right away!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_186a1b6b.png" NAME="Graphic107" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=571 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to change the header text and press &quot;Save
document and close&quot; - you are taken back to the webpage and the
change is immediately there:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2ee80220.png" NAME="Graphic108" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=411 HEIGHT=88 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is what frontend editing is - very intuitive,
great for correcting small mistakes, making small adjustments,
excellent for poorly skilled content contributers on your team etc.
It is the <I>context sensitive editing method</I> - raw power at your
fingertips.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">So can <I>everyone</I> just edit my pages?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">No, of course not - only when you are logged in in
the backend. Otherwise the icons are hidden - and if anyone could
click it we would be immediately rejected. Try it yourself - log out
in the backend:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">If you still have a frontend page with icons then
try to click one - you will see this screen instead of the edit form:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1dae02e8.png" NAME="Graphic110" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=362 HEIGHT=176 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">... and when you refresh the webpage you can see
that the icons are gone now:</P>

<P CLASS="western">Now, log in again at

<H4 CLASS="western">More information</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The frontend editing feature is also described in

<P CLASS="western">Now you know how to create and edit pages! That
was not so hard, was it? Quite easy to become a webmaster with TYPO3.
Later I'll even show you how you can delegate that work! The point of
a CMS is also that you can have many users maintaining content on the
same website! With full control over access rights etc. But that is
described in the end of this document.</P>
<P CLASS="western">So one thing is to make web pages for <I>all the
world</I> to see. What if we would like only a <I>part of the world</I>
to see them - our football team mates? Can we add password
protection?</P>
<P CLASS="western">Actually that is already done for you on the

</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Create users/group</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Before you can create access restricted pages you
must first and foremost have one or more frontend users and groups.
These can be created before, during or after creation of your
website. The order doesn't matter.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Frontend and backend users</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, wait a minute! How many kinds of users are
there? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Well, there are only two kinds. Remember that we
have two areas of TYPO3 - the frontend (website) and the backend
(administration). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>A frontend user</B> (orange icons) can log in
to the website of course. They cannot change content (since they have
nothing to do with the backend!) but they merely exist because it
allows us <I>restrict access</I> to information on the website! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Frontend users (also called &quot;Website users&quot;)
are created in the system where we want to create them. In our case
we have made a nice sysFolder called &quot;Users&quot; for both users
and groups. The only requirement of this storage place for the
frontend users is that we tell the template that this is the place to
<I>look</I> for the users when a login request is sent - more about
that in the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=491&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1363&amp;cHash=2c41424565">section

</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you want to create web applications with user
profiles in TYPO3 you will probably use the frontend users as a basis
for an extension which can add additional database fields to the user
table - thus you can store and manage custom information about
website users!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>A backend user</B> (blue icon) works in the
backend and is concerned with changing the information behind the
scenes. Because backend users are concerned with the <I>administration</I>
of a website they have nothing to do with the access restriction on
the website itself (which is only partially true of course since
backend users can <I>preview</I> hidden frontend pages).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Backend users can be created only one place - in
the page tree root (pid = 0) - and only by backend users that are
&quot;admin&quot; users (have the admin-flag set, which is indicated
by the red colored icon!) since they are the <I>only users</I> with
access to records in the page tree root:</P>

<P CLASS="western">The three blue backend users (#1) are configured
so they can maintain a little part of the website each - more about
that in the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=491&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1382&amp;cHash=65e1145f25">users

blue as well if the &quot;Access lists&quot; flag had not been set -
forgive me for that...

we are working as - is red because he has total and unrestricted

<P CLASS="western">Let’s try to create a user. Since frontend users
(like page, page content elements, news articles etc) are just
database elements <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">in TYPO3’s
opinion the same process of creation</SPAN> can be used for a
frontend user as for any other element. So this is even a general
introduction to creation of new elements! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Ready? It's simple. First, click the page icon of
the page where you want to create a new element:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3f53fb3a.png" NAME="Graphic127" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=194 HEIGHT=98 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">Then select the &quot;Website user&quot; element:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m29eef0ba.png" NAME="Graphic128" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=319 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">... and enter the information. In this case
username, password and group are required fields:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7565773f.png" NAME="Graphic129" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=523 HEIGHT=227 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save the user. If you click the page title of the
&quot;Users&quot; sysFolder you should see this listing (provided the
&quot;List&quot; module was the last backend module you used of
course):</P>

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">Go to the login form page again and see if it
works:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Create login form</H3>
<P CLASS="western">We already have a login form. But what if we want
another one on the frontpage? Is that a problem? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">No, since TYPO3 constructs page content by a
series of page content elements as you have learned we can simply
insert a login box as one of the content elements on the frontpage!
The question is rather where among the other elements.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, do the trivial: Page module -&gt; Click &quot;FC
Bigfeet&quot; -&gt; &quot;New content&quot; 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">Name it - save it:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you enter a page reference in the &quot;Send to
page&quot; box the login will be submitted to that page. This is used
with the other box so the user is directed to the access restricted
section directly. In this case we will just leave it empty which will
submit the form to the same page - the front page.</P>
<P CLASS="western">On the front end you will see this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<H3 CLASS="western">Create restricted page</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Now you have:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And save it. The page icon changes. Try to hold
the mouse over the icon:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_ed533f3.png" NAME="Graphic139" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=86 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">See! Access restricted to the &quot;Team&quot;
group. Try to log in and log out. Works? Should do so.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Oops!</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Try to log out and view one of the sub pages to
the &quot;Youth Section&quot; page. You will find that those pages
<I>can</I> be seen! So only the &quot;Youth Section&quot; page was
protected!? Yes, that's true - because you need to set an additional
flag - &quot;Include subpages&quot;.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Edit the page header and set the flag (bottom of
form):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4d1aaf50.png" NAME="Graphic140" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=51 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The page icon changes to include a double-forward
arrow - this indicates that now <I>all </I>subpages are in fact
protected as well!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m72779784.png" NAME="Graphic141" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Tip:</B> &quot;Include subpages&quot; affects
not only the Access setting - it also affects if a page is hidden or
has a Start or Stop time set. Thus you can also time or hide a whole
section by using this setting!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The Access options</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Basically access restriction works as simple as
this - just select a website user group and that's it. From that
point you just handle which users are members of which groups. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Groups... Ahh, yes, we have only <I>one </I>group
right now! The &quot;Team&quot; group. If you add <I>more groups</I>
then you can create <I>different</I> access rules for <I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">different
</SPAN></I>users! For instance &quot;john&quot; can be a member of
&quot;Team&quot; and access the &quot;Team&quot; section. &quot;irene&quot;
could be a member of a new group used for access restriction of the
&quot;Youth section&quot; and she would have access to that! The
&quot;newuser&quot; (we created) could be member of <I>both</I>
groups - and have access to <I>both</I> sections! Why not try it out!
Go and play with it.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally the option &quot;Hide at login&quot; means
that a page will <I>not </I>be visible when a user logs in! This is
useful if you have pages with information only relevant for users not
yet logged in. Of course the option &quot;Show at any login&quot; is
the opposite - that will enable the page for display for any user who
is logged in. No need to be a member of any particular group - if you
are logged in you are shown the page.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Special content
elements</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Previously you have been introduced to page
content elements in general. So you know how these work. In this
section I would like to show just a few examples of special content
elements that are nevertheless quite popular. For instance how can
you make an email form? Or a search box to search your site content?
What about a guest book? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Well, just read on and you will see.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Email form</H3>
<P CLASS="western">We already have an email box on the website. If
you go the the page &quot;Contact&quot; you will see such a form:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m31aa2d78.png" NAME="Graphic142" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=466 HEIGHT=317 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the backend the content element that creates
this form look like this in the Page module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6c69c7a8.png" NAME="Graphic143" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=217 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">By the way, notice the &quot;Thank you&quot; page
that is a sub page to the &quot;Contact&quot; page!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, edit the element. This is the form you see:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6f7cf167.png" NAME="Graphic144" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=509 HEIGHT=148 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The content is apparently even more &quot;code-style&quot;
than with the &quot;Table&quot; type content element! But as usual -
click the wizard icon and you can edit the content with a tool that
makes it all much easier!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m128defb9.png" NAME="Graphic145" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=513 HEIGHT=288 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see the codes are transformed into this
nice form. Here each field in the form is created by visual controls.
For a field you need to enter a label of course (#1) and a field type
(#2). <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">These are the visible parts.</SPAN>
You also have to give the field an <I>internal name</I> (#3) which is
the one that will be shown in the email the recipient gets. In the
case of &quot;Input field&quot; types you can also enter a default
value (#4).</P>
<P CLASS="western">For all email forms there are three common values
to be set: The name of the send button (#5), the subject line of the
email being sent (#6) and finally the email address of the person
that should receive the email (#7). This person is normally you! Or
whoever on your team that is supposed to respond to feedback.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Adding a selector box</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, let’s try to add a select box where people
can select an item to receive. In &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; we have year
calendars, the club magazine and pencils that we send to people. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Simply select the &quot;Selector box&quot; type:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3d950449.png" NAME="Graphic146" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=367 HEIGHT=145 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Then the
&quot;Refresh without saving&quot; button</SPAN> (which does <I>not</I>
save the content - just posts the content and redraws the form!)</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6527f03.png" NAME="Graphic147" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=41 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then enter this information:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3b69642a.png" NAME="Graphic148" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=516 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The label is obvious (#1). The field name
&quot;item_to_send&quot; (#2) is not visible on the web page but as I
wrote before - that is the name the email recipient will see to
identify this selection! Finally each value you want in the select
box is a line in this text field (#3) - as simple as that. Save the
content from the wizard and view the page:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5175162e.png" NAME="Graphic149" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">It's that easy!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">A few notes</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, in the backend the new selector box was added
in the lines of code in the &quot;Configuration&quot; field:</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you are curious about it try to look at the
line and you might actually figure out the syntax of creating form
fields without the wizard:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3ff35024.png" NAME="Graphic150" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=485 HEIGHT=153 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you lose your patience you can <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=270&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=367&amp;cHash=bbc518d930">seek
help in the TSref document</A> where a section tries to describe the
details. But be forewarned - this is the low level technical matters
that you are not used to yet!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Another important thing is the &quot;Jump to page&quot;
- this field simply tells TYPO3 which page to jump to when the form
is submitted. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2a3f95ae.png" NAME="Graphic151" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=395 HEIGHT=79 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In other words - when the user has filled in the
form and pressed the &quot;Send form!&quot; button he will be shown
this page which contains... an ordinary page content element with
this greeting:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mf1f9ba8.png" NAME="Graphic152" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=315 HEIGHT=83 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Quite simple - right? Very flexible.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Troubleshooting</H4>
<P CLASS="western">On windows servers there is a good chance that the
mail function will not work. If you send the form and get an error
message from PHP then you are most likely without an smtp-server or
whatever PHP needs to send mails. On UNIX this is normally working
out of the box.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Search box</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The next project is to implement a search box.
That is even more easy and one has already been created on the page
&quot;Search&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1810d033.png" NAME="Graphic153" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=104 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The element itself is extremely simple:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_62c54845.png" NAME="Graphic154" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=520 HEIGHT=166 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Basically its only the content element type set to
&quot;Search&quot; - that's all. In this case there is also a &quot;Send
to page&quot; field but not used. Does the same as the &quot;Jump to
page&quot; field for email forms - it tells the element which page
should receive the search request (which must contain another
&quot;Search&quot; content element in order to show results!). If not
given the current page will. This is quite normal with search boxes.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Conducting a search</H4>
<P CLASS="western">When searching for the word &quot;results&quot;
two pages come up:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1590bdc0.png" NAME="Graphic155" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=279 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to click &quot;Report results&quot; title:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5124916e.png" NAME="Graphic156" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=82 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You are then directed to the page and the search
words are nicely colored in red. Cute isn't it...</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Indexed searching?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The default search element you are using here is
searching directly in page and page content element records. This is
efficient enough for many smaller websites.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you need professional rated searching in
indexed content you can get that as well. In fact you can get
anything for which <I>an extension</I> has been written (more about
that later). For now you can try http://typo3.org as an example of
the indexed search engine that TYPO3 offers:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m74b45d54.png" NAME="Graphic157" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=146 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The result set will display something like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6f7a7378.png" NAME="Graphic158" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=495 HEIGHT=236 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice how the results are nicely organized in
sections and sorted by their percentage of relevance.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The extension doing all this has the <I>extension
key</I> &quot;indexed_search&quot; and the manual with <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=16&amp;cHash=0229a0ebfb">more
information about it can be found here</A>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Guest book</H3>
<P CLASS="western">A guest book is also a very simple thing to add.
However stuff like a guest book, message board, news module etc is
normally provided as extensions - and extensions need to be installed
first. They might even need to be imported from the online
repository, TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository) if they are not
available on the server yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To install an extension like the guest book you
simply go the Extension Manager (EM) and click the add icon:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6b68332.png" NAME="Graphic159" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=58 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the view &quot;Loaded extensions&quot; you can
see the list of installed (loaded) extensions:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_14950753.png" NAME="Graphic160" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=406 HEIGHT=230 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Inserting the guest book on a page</H4>
<P CLASS="western">As with the email form and search box a guest book
- and normally any other <I>web application</I> (called a &quot;plugin&quot;
in TYPO3 terminology) - is inserted by a page content element acting
as a placeholder for the functionality:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_c3f7032.png" NAME="Graphic161" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=485 HEIGHT=267 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Insert plugin&quot; type is the main
selector and secondarily the &quot;Plugin&quot; selector box is used
to determine the plugin type. The options reflect (some of) the
installed extensions:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m8eead53.png" NAME="Graphic162" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=89 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">We already have a general guest book - now let’s
create one for the &quot;Team pages&quot; section which requires
login by username and password:</P>
<P CLASS="western">Go to the Page module, click the &quot;Team pages&quot;
page title in the page tree and select &quot;New page&quot; wizard
(see previously):</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save and close. Then create page content:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_99a0387.png" NAME="Graphic165" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=494 HEIGHT=71 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><I>And now, just guess how easy it is to insert

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">And save the form you get:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice the &quot;CODE&quot; field - this contains
some text codes which make the guest book appear - a good reason for
using the &quot;New content&quot; wizard to insert the element since
they are preset then! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Of course you can enter a title and other content
elements to the page - but the main function is the insertion of this
element:</P>

<P CLASS="western">And - voila! - the guest book is there! (I filled
in a test entry here...)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Where is the guest book content stored?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">If you want to manage your guest book - for
instance remove unserious entries like mine above - then you simply
go to the Page module for the page and you will see all guest book
elements listed <I>in addition</I> to the normal page content
elements:</P>

<P CLASS="western">Wonder how to edit it? Just click the icon of the

</P>
<P CLASS="western">The same is true for the message board (as we use
it). <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">But not every plugin lists its
elements in the Page module,</SPAN> so ultimately we should generally
use the List module for management of elements if we want a common
approach:</P>

<P CLASS="western">This brings me to the main point here - guest book
entries are <I>also just database elements</I> in TYPO3 like pages,
page content element, users etc; we can edit them, hide them, delete
them and copy/paste them around with the already known set of tools
in the system - consistent concepts... you will love them soon!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Site map</H3>
<P CLASS="western">I'll not spend much time on the site map inserted
- you know the principle already. A content element of a certain type
with some additional settings applied:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Just notice the &quot;Starting point&quot; field -
that determines from which page the site map is drawn! Likewise other
&quot;Menu type&quot; settings uses this value. Instead of site map
you can also insert other kinds of &quot;link lists&quot; based on
the page structure and content elements on pages:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">You are invited to play around with this now.
Remember - <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">when you need help it’s
right at your fingertips:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_19d5b369.png" NAME="Graphic174" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=351 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">News plugin</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The news plugin used on the website is from the
&quot;mininews&quot; extension. So make sure that is installed
(Extension Manager):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_b3dc045.png" NAME="Graphic175" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=43 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Since it already was installed we can now
investigate how this plugin has been used. The important difference
from the guest book is that the mininews plugin is inserted both on
the front page (teasers) and on the news page (archive + details
view)! The point is that the front page shows the latest three news
items:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m66231fbe.png" NAME="Graphic176" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=503 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And by clicking the &quot;[more...]&quot; link the
user is directed to the News page where the full story is shown:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m71523487.png" NAME="Graphic177" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=493 HEIGHT=224 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The content elements in the backend</H4>
<P CLASS="western">On the front page you will find this content
element in the bottom of the page if you look at the page with the
Page module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_40915481.png" NAME="Graphic178" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=65 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The content is:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5f01870e.png" NAME="Graphic179" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=508 HEIGHT=230 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that first of all the &quot;Listing mode&quot;
- a selector box specifically provided for the plugin element - is
set to &quot;Frontpage teaser&quot; so the teaser and not the archive
is inserted. Secondly the &quot;Starting point&quot; field is used to
point to the page where the archive - which will list the full story
- is found!</P>
<P CLASS="western">On the &quot;News&quot; page a similar element is
inserted! Just the &quot;Listing mode&quot; field is different:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3ee2fc54.png" NAME="Graphic180" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=496 HEIGHT=162 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">And where are the news element stored?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Well, think back to the guest book: News elements
are elements like any other database element TYPO3 handles. The best
way to get a complete overview of the elements found on a page is by
the List module. Let’s try that:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">The Screenshots speak for themselves I think...</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">News workflow</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, what if I like another person to write the
news articles for me? And what if I want to review the news articles
before they get published? Can TYPO3 do that?</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is a situation that calls for a &quot;workflow&quot;.
Later in this tutorial exactly that is described for a simple
situation like the one we need here. So hang on.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Web
applications</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The term &quot;web applications&quot; is used for
&quot;programs&quot; on a website that perform a certain task which
includes real-time processing of data. For instance the guest book, a
search engine, a message board, a calculation form for insurance
costs or a membership registration form or online, searchable address
book are all web applications. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Many such applications today are stand-alone
applications with their own administration system etc. Content
management systems are also known for having such features but
normally within a framework that integrates the functionality.</P>
<P CLASS="western">TYPO3 is such a system - a web application
platform - which greatly helps not only applying and managing but
also developing such applications! With the Extension Manager the
installation and distribution is as easy as a mouse click and with
the Kickstarter you can get started in 2 minutes with your own
applications. If you are interested in these issues you should watch
the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1407.0.html">&quot;Episode&quot;
videos you will find in the Video page</A> on typo3.org. In addition
a number of tutorials exist on the issue of extension creation, for
instance <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=468&amp;cHash=7f1759266d">the
one made my Oliver Hofmann</A>. Notice that this is stuff for the
higher level and since you are a beginner right now don't expect
either to understand it nor to develop anything before you are a
little more experienced with TYPO3!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Content management from the &quot;Page Tree&quot;
paradigm?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">When you categorize Content Management systems you
find some which approach the issue from the &quot;Application
Framework&quot; angle and others from the &quot;Page Tree&quot;
angle. TYPO3 belongs to the latter part. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">However this does not in any <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">way
compromise TYPO3’s status</SPAN> as a Content Management
Application Framework. Rather the page tree approach <I>enhances</I>
the ability to serve exactly this purpose by offering the logical
division of the page tree as containers for such applications. In
other words: You can have <I>both</I> a guest book, news system, user
management form and insurance cost calculation in the same system
<I>without </I>things getting mixed up <I>because </I>each
applications would normally operate within the boundaries of a <I>single
page</I>! All elements for the application are stored there, all
transactions are performed by the same plugin on the same page id.
Makes perfect sense and order! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">So the page tree backbone becomes <I>the strength</I>
of the system even when hundreds of web applications in the framework
needs an organizational structure!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Extending TYPO3 by third party web applications?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Let’s now take a look at how we can extend TYPO3
by a web application which is not delivered with the system. For that
purpose we will connect to the TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository) from
the EM (Extension Manager) and import, install and apply a newsletter
subscription system.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Inserting a newsletter subscription form</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Generally you will go to typo3.org first and
search for the application you need. When it has been found you will
install it. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m610ea3af.png" NAME="Graphic187" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=445 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the search for a newsletter subscription engine
we found one which seems to fit the needs. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Notice
how the author has bothered to make documentation</SPAN> available!
(#1). This is also very important for you to understand - that the
documentation for TYPO3 is organized with each extension. In other
words, where can you find all information related to the &quot;Newsletter
Subscription Module&quot;? On typo3.org together with that extension!
Therefore seeking documentation often requires you to first identify
which extension you need help for - then go to that extension on
typo3.org!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Import</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In the EM you connect to TER and find the
extension with the key &quot;da_newsletter_subscription&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m649ab4f3.png" NAME="Graphic188" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=204 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The connection takes a few seconds and then this
list appears:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m7d9fa257.png" NAME="Graphic189" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=71 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">After some seconds the extension is imported and
you will see this message if that happened without problems:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m22127a5f.png" NAME="Graphic190" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=173 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the list of &quot;Available extensions&quot;
you can now find the &quot;Newsletter Subscription Module&quot; under
&quot;Frontend Plugins&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mfc545c.png" NAME="Graphic191" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=443 HEIGHT=49 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Install it, accept the &quot;Make updates&quot;
(which will <I>automatically</I> create the needed database tables
and fields!!)...</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_11d8a0e4.png" NAME="Graphic192" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=208 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the list of &quot;Loaded Extensions&quot; you
can now see the new extension has been added:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5ed11435.png" NAME="Graphic193" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=467 HEIGHT=155 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Now, how do I use it?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Well, it's such a luck that the author of the
extension actually made a manual! So on typo3.org you can <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=323&amp;cHash=0720264e16">access
the index table</A> and there is a detailed guide to the creation of
both <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=323&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1139&amp;cHash=c24b237a10">the
subscription form, the categories</A> and how to <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=323&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1140&amp;cHash=36e0acf2e2">get
the list of subscribers</A> out of the system again!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Of course I'm not going to repeat all that! There
was a reason for writing the manual of the extension in the first
place.</P>
<P CLASS="western">But in short I have created a new page, a content
element, two categories and an age selector:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_49de5a1a.png" NAME="Graphic194" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=532 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">A little more than this has to be done (changes to
the template) but you can see that on the video where the process is
shown live. And of course it is documented in the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=323&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1144&amp;cHash=80df0fd159">Configuration
section of the manual</A> found on typo3.org.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The resulting form will look like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2dfca025.png" NAME="Graphic196" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=443 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The final point is that the extraction of the
subscriber list is simply provided by a backend module that followed
the plugin in the extension:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4f35d87b.png" NAME="Graphic195" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=117 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">As you can see,
when the backend module is activated,</SPAN> the page containing the
web application on the frontend is activated and the list is shown.
This also tells us another interesting thing - we could add
newsletter subscriptions to not just <I>one </I>page but <I>any
number </I>of pages on the site and still have a perfect order and
control over the situation. Thanks to the <I>page tree</I> framework!</P>
<P CLASS="western">For more information on advanced extracts of
subscribers see the manual for the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=323&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1140&amp;cHash=36e0acf2e2">Newsletter
Subscription Module</A>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Changing the language of the subscription form?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Many plugins are <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">translated
to languages other than English.</SPAN> However English is required
to be the primary language of all plugins.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If a translation is available you can normally
activate it by editing the <I>&quot;Setup&quot; field</I> of the 
<I>template record</I> of your website and insert this code line:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">	page.config.language = dk</PRE><P CLASS="western">
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This will activate the danish (dk) language and
the form will now look like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4f8950a6.png" NAME="Graphic197" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=496 HEIGHT=170 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Backend modules</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Tracking backend users</H3>
<P CLASS="western">What about tracking the login users? Can we do
that?</P>
<P CLASS="western">Well, yes of course. Actually there already <I>is</I>
an extension which provides a backend module for that!</P>
<P CLASS="western">So like before, import the extension &quot;Login
User Tracking&quot; from TER:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6a42372b.png" NAME="Graphic198" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=473 HEIGHT=44 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">Install it, &quot;Make updates&quot; (it will add
a statistics table to the database):</P>

<P CLASS="western">And reload the backend:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3dd7c42b.png" NAME="Graphic200" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=63 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">And the new backend module is installed under the

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1da99f8.png" NAME="Graphic201" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Before the registration of frontend logins will
work we have to enable it in the template record (just like with the
language setting for the newsletter form):</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">	config.tx_loginusertrack_enable = 1</PRE><P CLASS="western">
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Unfortunately this is (currently) not documented
well and I had to look into the source code of the plugin to figure
this out. Shame on you, extension author (hmm, that is a slap in my
own face. D'oh!). (Watch video to see it done).</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Since the plugin has just been installed we need
to login and out a few times in the frontend. After having done that
the &quot;User Track&quot; module will show a nice list of logins:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<H3 CLASS="western">Changing backend language</H3>
<P CLASS="western">A little side note here might be how to change the
language of the backend! That is really easy. Users can do that
themselves if they have access to the &quot;Setup&quot; module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Just select another language than English and
press the &quot;Save Configuration&quot; button in the bottom of the

<P CLASS="western">Reload the backend interface and you will see the

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Templates</H2>
<P CLASS="western">During this lengthy document you might have
wondered time and again - how can I change that green background
color? Or how can I put in my own logo. And the fonts - I want Times,
not Arial and Verdana.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Before we look at these issues you must <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">understand
something fundamental about how most CMSs work: they</SPAN> separate
content from presentation. This means the pages and content are
stored in the database <I>without</I> any colors or fonts or
background images attached to them. That information is instead
located in the <I>template</I> and stylesheets which normally apply
to the whole website when pages are shown. Thus a <I>single</I>
change in the template will affect the <I>overall appearance </I>of
the website for all pages. This is a great and very important feature
of a CMS! Just ask people who made an html-file based website with
100+ pages and wanted to make a redesign...</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Static and dynamic content</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Consider the &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; website:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_47915fbe.png" NAME="Graphic206" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=620 HEIGHT=512 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Dynamic parts:</B> On this website the menu
(#1), the page headers (#2) and the &quot;Last update&quot; section
(#4) are <I>indirectly dynamic parts</I> of the page. This means they
change from page to page automatically. We cannot directly affect
these items <I>per page</I>. They are dynamically programmed <I>parts
of the template</I>. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">However the content area (#3) is a <I>directly
dynamic part</I> of the page since this is where the page specific
content is inserted. We can affect this by adding, removing and
rearranging <I>page content elements</I>! This area is not at all a
part of the template (excepts its formatting in colors and fonts)
since we directly control it by the content elements.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Static parts:</B> Apart from the dynamic parts
the template consists always of the same logo (#5), the same
background image (#6) and the same background color (#7). These parts
are also a part of the template (like the indirectly dynamic parts)
but they <I>never </I>change by any action. Always the same on each
page.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Template records?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">So how does TYPO3 implement this principle? Well,
you can read in-depth information about the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=442&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=1273&amp;cHash=e678dd49eb">recommended
approach for professionally made website in the tutorial Modern
Template Building</A>. However this is written for people who are
professionally working with web design in teams with developers,
designers etc. So the level is a bit higher than this tutorial claims
to be. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">But the main point is - the <I>template record</I>.
This is a <I>control element </I>that <I>instructs</I> TYPO3 how to
handle a certain <I>branch</I> of the page tree. If this seems like
an awkward approach to you at first then so be it - it's in fact
highly consistent with what you have learned already and further it
makes perfect sense when you later wants to make <I>many </I>sites in
the <I>same </I>page tree including <I>multiple templates </I>etc.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you look at the simple FC Bigfeet website in
our case notice that the root page of the website contains such a
template record:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3da90aaa.png" NAME="Graphic205" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=175 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Making changes to the template</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Let’s try to change a few things in the template
record, &quot;NEW SITE, based on standard&quot;. Simply edit it:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5e34656c.png" NAME="Graphic207" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=477 HEIGHT=247 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">For standard templates the &quot;Constants&quot;
field is often the place to change values. Constants are later
inserted in the Setup field and can be inserted many places. So one
change to a constant may mean many changes different places in the
final <I>TypoScript configuration code</I> of the template. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In our case, let’s add a red background color in
the menu frame (see above).</P>
<P CLASS="western">After saving the template record, click &quot;Clear
all cache&quot; in the &quot;Admin Functions&quot; menu:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m26469c99.png" NAME="Graphic208" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=107 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Always do that</B> if you edit template records
<I>directly</I> (not needed when you use the Template module though).</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The result is:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3ff87aca.png" NAME="Graphic209" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=199 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can play with other values as well!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The constant editor</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The better way to handle these changes is to use
the Template module in the &quot;Constant Editor&quot; view:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6c01efa3.png" NAME="Graphic210" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=105 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can access a lot of options here, there are
visual explanations for most of them and you can select from various
categories. You can also find the menu background colors listed here
(&quot;Basic&quot; category):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_64f78e83.png" NAME="Graphic211" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=490 HEIGHT=82 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice how this is really just a wizard that edits
the constant from before called &quot;menu.bgCol&quot;!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Likewise you can easily change and upload images
for use as logos or background images:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_50cd58f0.png" NAME="Graphic212" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=510 HEIGHT=223 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Here we change the current background image to be
the logo instead (#1) and with the &quot;Browse&quot; button you can
pick up a local image on your hard drive to use as a new logo - soon
you will have a website for your <I>company</I> and not a football
club!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, there is no reason for telling you more about
these features since they are pretty obvious and the only way for you
to get acquainted with them is to use them, play with them, see what
happens. So do that!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Configuring the front end user folder?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Remember the notice about the required change in
the template before the frontend user logins would work? This is the
place to discuss that.</P>
<P CLASS="western">See, when the login form is rendered it needs to
know in which page (sysFolder) to look for the users that are allowed
to log in. This is done by setting a constant -
&quot;styles.content.loginform.pid&quot; - to the uid value of the
sysFolder &quot;Users&quot;. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In this example, the uid of the storage sysFolder
is &quot;14&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7d1961d5.png" NAME="Graphic338" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=59 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">So all we need to do is set the number &quot;14&quot;
in this field:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_9061a27.png" NAME="Graphic185" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=486 HEIGHT=108 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This field is found among the 64 values listed
under the CONTENT category of the Constant Editor. You can set the
value manually in the &quot;Constants&quot; field as well of course.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Setup field</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The best way to edit a templates Setup or
Constants field really is to use the &quot;Info/Modify&quot; view.
Here you get direct access to the fields from the template record.
This is done as a help for developers who will be using this a lot:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m410b73d8.png" NAME="Graphic213" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=505 HEIGHT=360 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">(Notice how  there is a link (#1) below the menu
block which directly points you to editing of the full template
record if you need it).</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the setup field you find a few lines:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_42857023.png" NAME="Graphic214" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=409 HEIGHT=144 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">These are clearly strange codes to you and they do
require a manual and some background knowledge to get done right! So
don't worry. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The first line (#1) inserts an alternative sitemap
to the default (which is quite boring), then a stylesheet is
configured for the page (#2). This is used by the &quot;mininews&quot;
plugin which has all it's formatting done by CSS (contrary to other
parts of this standard template which is from the time where
&lt;font&gt;-tags were mainly used). Finally we find configuration
for the newsletter plugin (#3). This was needed to make sure people
didn't need to first receive an email with a link before they could
subscribe. Then the danish language was configured (#4) and the Login
User Tracking feature enabled (#5).</P>
<P CLASS="western">This was just a short description. Remember that
these options does <I>not</I> speak for themselves. You will need
more knowledge from various source (<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=270&amp;cHash=4ad9d7acb4">like
TSref</A>) before you understand them fully. For now you can just
conclude that the Setup field is apparently the place to add such
stuff! And this stuff is called <I>TypoScript!</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Object Browser</H3>
<P CLASS="western">As a final note to the Setup field (for now) I
will introduce the Object Browser:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4e0b3770.png" NAME="Graphic215" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=519 HEIGHT=394 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tool shows visually the object tree of the
TypoScript from the Setup field. If you noticed the TypoScript line
for the danish language configuration (&quot;page.config.language =
dk&quot;) you can clearly see the logic of this tree view. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that TypoScript is really <I>not a
scripting language</I> with control structures but rather a
<I>declarational configuration language</I> which creates an
<I>information hierarchy</I> used internally to <I>instruct the
template engine</I> what to do and in which order - much like the
Registration Database in Windows. If TYPO3 has any scripting language
it is PHP itself! Therefore TypoScript is not a new, proprietary
technology that should have been XSLT instead or so - rather
TypoScript is an unavoidable - and in that case brilliant -
configuration language to bind external parts together (such as
content, templates, PHP and XML or whatever). But well, you <I>will
</I>have to learn it of course. But there really is no alternative
and the degree to which you want to use TypoScript is partly up to
you. But you will know more from other tutorials about this.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Back to work: If you &quot;Enable Object Links&quot;
(bottom of page) you can even change the values from this great
visual overview:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m12eb7fd5.png" NAME="Graphic216" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Click the <I>property</I> you want to edit:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2fa7d1f1.png" NAME="Graphic217" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=53 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Change the <I>value</I> and save:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m35ffe6f5.png" NAME="Graphic218" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=441 HEIGHT=61 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">It's that easy!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, how could you know what this option means?
Well, you will still need a little more background knowledge but the
TS wizard helps you with the syntax when you know what to look for:</P>
<P CLASS="western">For the &quot;page.config&quot; <I>object</I>
there are <I>properties</I> which can be displayed with the
TSreference Wizard:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_53f5f80d.png" NAME="Graphic219" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=80 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the window that pops up you can now search for
the object that you need the property reference for. This is the part
where you have to know what applies to your specific object page (in
our case &quot;page.config&quot;):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1322ff5b.png" NAME="Graphic221" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=178 HEIGHT=60 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And the next screen will conveniently show you the
properties.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_467018dd.png" NAME="Graphic220" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In fact this information is drawn directly from
the online manuals and could also have been found on typo3.org. Just
look at <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=270&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=338&amp;cHash=6a7c6eecbb">the
CONFIG object in TSref</A>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">TSref</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1400.0.html">TypoScript
reference (TSref)</A> is a very well known document in the collection
of documents that belongs to TYPO3. It contains the description of
all the TypoScript objects you can use to create templates in TYPO3.
It's the manual on what content you can put into the Setup field of
template records.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Before you dive into TSref please notice that it
only makes sense if you know what  you are looking for already! It's
a reference listing all properties. So if you know which property to
search for it's very useful - even indispensable!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">TypoScript by Example</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The better way to go if you want play around on
your own is <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=269&amp;cHash=39e3faa590">TypoScript
by Example</A>. This document contains a lot of examples arranged as
mini-tutorials on TypoScript related topics. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Change template?</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Well in our case the FC Bigfeet template is based
on the <I>standard template</I> called &quot;BUSINESS&quot;. This is
where all the <I>other</I> configuration seen in the object browser
comes from!</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can see this structure with the &quot;Template
Analyzer&quot; view in the Template module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m45e132a2.png" NAME="Graphic222" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=258 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">All the
&quot;elements&quot; in this upside-down tree represent</SPAN>
pre-made TypoScript content for the template! So when you look at the
Setup or Constant field of the main template record &quot;NEW SITE,
based on standard&quot; (#1) and think where all the real stuff comes
from - that is the answer. It has been pre-included from <I>static
templates</I> by the parser. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you want to see the content for each element,
just click its title.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Static templates</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The <I>static template</I> &quot;styles.sitemap.gs&quot;
was included in order to get the nice tree-style sitemap on the web
site. The <I>static template file</I>
&quot;Ext:da_newsletter_subscript...&quot; was included to get the
configuration right for the newsletter subscription (see the video
previously). Finally the static template &quot;template; BUSINESS&quot;
(standard template) is the key element to our websites look.</P>
<P CLASS="western">All this is editable within the template record.
Go to the list module and edit it:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_8d2b706.png" NAME="Graphic223" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=514 HEIGHT=420 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Clearly the &quot;Include static&quot; field
contains the static templates as I told you (#1 and #2) and the
&quot;Include static (from extensions)&quot; holds the reference to
the <I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">static template file</SPAN></I>
from the Newsletter extensions (#3). The checkboxes &quot;Clear&quot;
and &quot;Rootlevel&quot; should normally just be set (#4) for main
templates.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Generally static templates are not used so much in
professional websites made with TYPO3. The reason is that such
websites are normally <I>custom work</I> requiring custom TypoScript
code. Static templates contain <I>general</I> TypoScript and that is
very useful but also limited to some degree.</P>
<P CLASS="western">However in almost any template - even custom
designs - a static template for rendering the <I>page content
elements</I> is included. This is done since creating templates and
rendering code for the total number of combinations of content
element is a very large job and therefore it make a lot of sense to
reuse code there!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Change template</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Let’s try another standard template than the one
called &quot;BUSINESS&quot;. In the &quot;Include static&quot; field
remove the BUSINESS template and add the CANDIDATE template instead:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2003bf46.png" NAME="Graphic224" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=508 HEIGHT=172 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save the result, click &quot;Clear All Cache&quot;
and check out the website:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m771b2ba0.png" NAME="Graphic225" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=595 HEIGHT=646 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see the content elements are the same,
the background color the same, the stylesheet used for the news
teasers is the same - but the template is different! This is what
templates do! They change the overall structure of the website! This
is how easy it would be to make a re-design of a 10, 100 or 1000 page
website in TYPO3 - a single change in a template affects all pages!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now in this new template there seems to be a
feature we didn't have before. That is the border column.  We can put
content here.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Content in multiple columns</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">Page TSconfig</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The first thing we have to do is to change the
&quot;Page TSconfig&quot; option that keeps TYPO3 from displaying
more than just the &quot;Normal&quot; content column in the Page
module. Edit the page header of the root page &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6d17d8fa.png" NAME="Graphic226" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=221 HEIGHT=196 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Add &quot;,3&quot; to the list as shown here:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2e849d83.png" NAME="Graphic227" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=472 HEIGHT=103 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This will instruct the Page module to display both
the Normal (0) and Border (3) content column. If you want to know
about possible options to set, click the &quot;TS&quot; button to the
right. In the window that pops up, find &quot;mod.SHARED&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m77cedd42.png" NAME="Graphic228" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=86 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This will show you the property &quot;colPos_list&quot;
including a description of what it does. It even also allows you to
click the property and it will be transferred back to the TSconfig
field.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m7b27861b.png" NAME="Graphic229" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=127 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save the page header and go the Page module - you
will now see an additional content column shown:<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1c7de9.png" NAME="Graphic230" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=518 HEIGHT=166 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, try to add a content element here. Just click
the &quot;New&quot; icon:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3f8d5526.png" NAME="Graphic231" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=86 HEIGHT=83 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then select an ordinary &quot;Text&quot; element
type and enter some content:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3cb9fa68.png" NAME="Graphic232" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=540 HEIGHT=234 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice the content of the field &quot;Columns&quot;
from the secondary options of the &quot;Type&quot; field - it has the
value &quot;Border&quot;. This is precisely the setting that will
make this content element appear in the Border column and not the
Normal column! This field was preset before creation of this form.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Press &quot;Save document and close&quot; button.
Back in the Page module you will see the new content nicely presented
in the right column as expected:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5b1b8437.png" NAME="Graphic233" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=536 HEIGHT=169 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">But it should also be displayed on the website at
the right position! So check the frontend as well:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m115c5379.png" NAME="Graphic234" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And that was the case right away!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Understanding &quot;Page TSconfig&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, the little change we did in the &quot;TSconfig&quot;
field of the root page was quite interesting. This was a piece of
configuration code which had some effect on how the backend works -
in that particular branch of the page tree! &quot;Page TSconfig&quot;
is thus a powerful concept that allows you to fine tune the behavior
of modules, Rich Text Editor and other elements. The syntax of the
codes you enter is TypoScript syntax - the same as used for the
template records. But it has nothing to do with templates in the
frontend - only the configuration internally of features. Like you
just saw - enabling another column for content in the Page module!</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you want to know about the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=263&amp;cHash=1f1b106a30">properties
of TSconfig</A> you can find the reference for it on typo3.org. This

<H4 CLASS="western">Verifying Page TSconfig</H4>

<P CLASS="western">As you can see - same kind of tree structure shown
as in the Object Browser. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Undo the template change</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Before we continue let us reset the template to
the BUSINESS type again. If you didn't make any changes to the
template record in the mean time we can easily do this by just
clicking the Undo button - that will restore the previous state of
the record in the database. Select &quot;Edit&quot; for the template
record:</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Creating another website in the database?</H3>
<P CLASS="western">TYPO3 has the ability to create not just <I>one</I>
website but <I>any number of websites</I> in the same database! This
is a powerful capability called &quot;multi site&quot;. The principle
is that a new website can start from <I>any page</I> in the page tree
and the way to indicate the starting page (root page) of a new site
to TYPO3 is by inserting a template record!</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you thought that template records are a strange
approach to creating templates <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">then
you should now see why they are a very efficient solution to this
problem</SPAN> - because the template record becomes the <I>control
element</I> you insert on a page to start new sites. Thus as soon as
you need more than just one website in the page tree you need a
concept like this to make it happen!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now, let’s try it in practice:</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Creating a new branch</H4>
<P CLASS="western">First you create a new page under the current one,
then add a few sub pages to it. This is going to be the start of a

<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Fan club&quot; is your new <I>root page</I>
for this site. Try to view it:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2ea4ce6a.png" NAME="Graphic239" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=50 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_62a156ef.png" NAME="Graphic240" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=87 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Why? Well the answer is in the principle I told
you about before - we have <I>not yet created a template record</I>
on the root page so TYPO3 knows that this <I>is the root page</I>!
The easiest way to come about this is to fire up the Template module,
select the &quot;Info/Modify&quot; view and use the wizard there:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m45ed6439.png" NAME="Graphic241" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=174 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Find a standard template you want as a basis of
your new website:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m5cac0616.png" NAME="Graphic242" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=307 HEIGHT=184 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Confirm the creation of the new template and go to
the List module to verify the existence of the new template record:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mb913fbc.png" NAME="Graphic243" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=190 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now the interesting moment comes - did this solve
the problem? Hit the frontend again:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m41cd776e.png" NAME="Graphic244" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=220 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And yes it did! Of course the pages are empty
since no content exists yet. And the template must be configured with
the &quot;Constant Editor&quot; with other colors etc. That is the
next step now.</P>
<P CLASS="western">It is probably not a surprise to you that the page
id sent to the browser was &quot;34&quot; - the id of the page from
the site. But which one of the two websites in the database will be
displayed now if we do not send any id? The answer is the first one -
the &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; site.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Well, if that is the case how do people every get
to visit our new site? Read on...</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Controlling multiple domains</H3>
<P CLASS="western">When you want to manage multiple websites inside
your TYPO3 database you simply make sure they have a separate domain
each. For instance the &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; websites could have the
domain &quot;www.fc-bigfeet.com&quot; and the fan club website could
be &quot;fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot; and also
&quot;www.fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot;. The challenge now is to make
sure that people get to see the right thing when going to the right
domain!</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is a three step process:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Make sure that the DNS of all domains point
	to your webserver (trivial, non-TYPO3 related issue)</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Configure your web server to direct all
	requests for the three domains to the directory with the
	TYPO3-website (.../quickstart/) - now a visit to any of the three
	domains will end on the &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; main site.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Finally create a <I>domain record</I> for
	each domain you want to end up on the &quot;Fan Club&quot; website.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is done by adding a new element to the root
page &quot;Fan Club&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_421e1069.png" NAME="Graphic246" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=460 HEIGHT=140 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then enter the main domain name:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m54d4a3dc.png" NAME="Graphic247" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=397 HEIGHT=50 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save the record.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Create another one. This time for the alternative
domain &quot;www.fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot;. Since this is
basically a domain we use for &quot;safety&quot; we want it to
redirect to the &quot;fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot; domain. This is
done like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2a0d3813.png" NAME="Graphic248" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=463 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save it and view the page in the list module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m150a49e6.png" NAME="Graphic249" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=256 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Nicely the two records are found in the List
module display of the &quot;Fan club&quot; page elements. If you
configured everything correctly a hit to
&quot;http://fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot; will show the <I>new
</I>website and the &quot;http://www.fc-bigfeet.com&quot; URL will
show the <I>old </I>one (default). Of course it didn't work - unless
you hurried to register these domains lately!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Behind the scenes this is what happens: TYPO3
detects the domain name. Then it tries to look for a domain record.
If such a one is found (like &quot;fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot;) then
TYPO3 <I>locks itself</I> to that page as root page! This means that
any request for page ids must be within the branch where the domain
record was found! If a page id from the &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; is
requested on the domain &quot;fanclub.fc-bigfeet.com&quot; then TYPO3
will just show the front page of the &quot;Fan Club&quot; website!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Starting up new websites</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">Using the New template wizard</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The feature &quot;Create template for a new site&quot;
of the &quot;Info/Modify&quot; view is very practical for starting up
new websites. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5f10071f.png" NAME="Graphic245" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=53 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you just click it without selecting a standard
template you will still get a new template record - but without any
standard template and with a few lines of dummy TypoScript content to
get started. This is the way the pros are normally starting up new
custom made sites and then they work from there with their knowledge
of the TypoScript etc. This is precisely the process suggested in the
tutorial &quot;Modern Template Building, Part 1&quot;.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Framework for new projects?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">When you want to start your own new websites you
normally do it with a clean database. If you want that - a totally
clean database with no pages, no content and only one &quot;admin&quot;
user - then download the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/1274.0.html">&quot;Dummy&quot;
package from typo3.org.</A> This is designed as start-up framework
for new projects.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Since you are still a newbee with TYPO3 - or if
you are just very lazy - you might also start up new projects with
the  &quot;QuickStart&quot; package - the one we are using here! The
reason is that it already contains a bunch of users, a template, some
content already in place etc. You would just have to remove the
template, make a new one, rearrange pages and add new content while
removing the parts you don't need. This is probably a good idea if
you need to get started quickly.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Template disclaimer!</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Since the &quot;template&quot; is the crucial
point of your implementation possibilities with a CMS it's very
important to stress that <I>this tutorial</I> does <I>not</I> to any
degree display the depth of possibilities with templates in TYPO3. On
purpose I have used a very boring standard template which has a touch
of amateur look over it. That is fully on purpose so we don't get
lost in these issues. Remember, the point of this tutorial was to
teach you <I>principles </I>of TYPO3. Those principles also apply for
professional use of the product. But the implementation of templates
will be much different.</P>
<P CLASS="western">So please notice: This tutorial was based on a
fully functional website with a template already in place! You have
not (in details at least) learned how to implement your own custom
design. That is what all of the remaining tutorials is about (almost)
 - so the &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; site is <I>only</I> meant as an
hands-on introduction - customizing templates is the big science <I>not</I>
covered here!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Facts about templates and possibilities</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Just to nail it to your mind for sure, this are
some facts about templates in TYPO3:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can implement <I>any</I> design you like,
	the way you like.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can have any number of menu levels.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can have multiple sites, multiple
	templates.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can have pages in any number of
	languages.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can have multiple content areas (columns)
	on a page.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can integrate all kinds of external data
	sources through PHP written plugins.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can add any number of web applications to
	run on various pages in TYPO3.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can extend everything with PHP (with full
	backwards compatibility!).</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You can do anything - some things are just
	more straightforward (most typical things), other things are more
	tricky (less typical things).</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">If you need a look at the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.com/Feature_list.1243.0.html">feature
list of TYPO3 you can find it here</A> on typo3.com.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Develop professional websites with TYPO3?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The tutorial &quot;<A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=442&amp;cHash=d442c244f7">Modern
Template Building, Part 1</A>&quot; is the document to read if you
want to get into the template building as it is recommended for
newbees on a professional level. That document is a sequel to this
one so after finishing this tutorial, just go on to that one!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Image archives</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Managing files in TYPO3</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Let’s look at another interesting module - the
File module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m598468c6.png" NAME="Graphic250" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This works by the same principle as the List
module for database elements - it has a folder tree and a list view
of files in the folders.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The folder displayed by default (for &quot;admin&quot;
users)  is the &quot;fileadmin/&quot; folder located under the
&quot;quickstart/&quot; directory. Here a little image archive
already exists. These files are not used on the website directly. If
we want to do so we can either a) link to the files from content
elements or b) pick the files in the process of selecting files for
content elements.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Using files from the archive in your content
elements</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The latter approach is the most typical. Try to
insert an image element on the front page of the &quot;Fan Club&quot;
site:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4f0c2efd.png" NAME="Graphic251" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=465 HEIGHT=45 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And instead of uploading one image at a time by
the &quot;Browse&quot; button you can select <I>multiple files</I>
already on the server!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6caac781.png" NAME="Graphic252" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=314 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">After saving the files are attached to the record.
Notice that contrary to what you might think the files are now <I>moved</I>
to the uploads/pics/ folder where TYPO3 stores images attached to
page content elements. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5ad4f128.png" NAME="Graphic253" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=536 HEIGHT=174 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And on the front page you have got a nice block of
images:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m7551cd45.png" NAME="Graphic254" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=303 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Notice that there are really a lot of options
related to images in TYPO3. Enable &quot;Show secondary options&quot;
and see for yourself:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_504ba459.png" NAME="Graphic255" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=492 HEIGHT=335 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The most important option is the &quot;Position&quot;
selector (#1). With this you tell TYPO3 how to position the block of
images (there are three images, remember!) in <I>relation to text</I>.
This is mostly important when using the &quot;Text w/Image&quot;
element type of course. Secondly the &quot;Columns&quot; selector
(#2) is important since this is responsible for organizing the images
into columns, in this case &quot;2&quot;. The &quot;Border&quot;
option (#3) is nice since a black border is surrounding the images
and that looks good most of the time. The &quot;Width&quot; field
(#4) determines the image block width in pixels - very useful as
well. The &quot;Link&quot; box (#5) can set a link for the images
unless the &quot;Click-enlarge&quot; option (#6) is selected which
will enable a link for all images which opens a window with an
enlarged version inside! Very nice feature for galleries! Finally the
&quot;Caption&quot; field is for the text under images.</P>
<P CLASS="western">And finally remember:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m4276a6bc.png" NAME="Graphic256" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The little funky &quot;?&quot; icon - help at your
fingertips! Use it!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Browsing the image archive</H3>
<P CLASS="western">If you use the Images module instead of Filelist
you will have a larger view of the images:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4bb86fa0.png" NAME="Graphic257" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=237 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Alternatively you can enable the thumbnails view
in the Filelist module:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2acfc424.png" NAME="Graphic258" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">... and that might be good enough for you:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_585e5b35.png" NAME="Graphic259" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=426 HEIGHT=202 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Uploading images to the archive</H3>
<P CLASS="western">One way to get images to the archive would be
through FTP. But of course you can upload directly in the File
module. Just click the folder icons:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_1751c53e.png" NAME="Graphic260" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=255 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This will bring up a form where you can upload
files:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1981f8d3.png" NAME="Graphic261" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=201 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Likewise files can be renamed, copied, deleted etc
- all by the functions available in the context menus you are
familiar with already:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2b69c557.png" NAME="Graphic263" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=96 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Note on image processing in TYPO3</H3>
<P CLASS="western">If you are not so lucky you didn't see some of the
images in these screen shots on your own server. This might be
because ImageMagick was not properly detected on your server. If you
used the Windows Installer Package for installing the QuickStart site
it should work. But with a custom installation - and if you didn't
install it yourself - you probably didn't see all the great things
happen. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You will have to consult the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=298&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[tocEl]=804&amp;cHash=4f4247f04c">installation

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">The List module
and Clipboard</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The List module contains some very powerful
features for managing the database content. Let’s just think about
it for a moment: All the <I>page and page content  related</I>
business went on in the Page module - it was designed for that! All
template editing we did was done in the Template module - it was
designed for that! But on the lower level, behind the scenes, the
List module is the ultimate place to manage both pages, page content
elements, template records, domain records, users and groups, guest
book items and whatever elements TYPO3 is capable of managing!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Using the List module effectively</H3>
<P CLASS="western">You might already have used the clipboard to move
a content element from one page to another. But let’s see what
happens behind the scenes:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_76989747.png" NAME="Graphic264" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=503 HEIGHT=304 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">On the &quot;This week&quot; page we have three
content elements. View the page content with the List module, enable
the &quot;Clipboard&quot; checkbox and select &quot;Copy&quot; for an
element. Notice how this element gets registered in the clipboard
that is shown now! (You will have to refresh the List module before
it's shown).</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you select another element the first one is
removed. &quot;Cutting&quot; element is the same - it's just being
registered as &quot;Cut&quot; instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you enable &quot;Extended view&quot; checkbox
you can see a whole panel of nifty little buttons which are all great
shortcuts instead of activating the context menu all the time:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2c2aa30c.png" NAME="Graphic265" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=487 HEIGHT=158 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">Try to play around with the buttons here!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<H3 CLASS="western">The numeric clipboard pads - managing many

<P CLASS="western">Back to the clipboard - select one of the &quot;numeric

<P CLASS="western">Now you can tick off the elements to select for

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">User Management</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Distributed maintenance</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The final steps in our efforts to get this website
for &quot;FC Bigfeet&quot; running is to look at distributed
maintenance - a core requirement to a CMS.</P>
<P CLASS="western">We already discussed the difference between
frontend and backend users and how backend users were located in the
root of the page tree:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3e25089.png" NAME="Graphic280" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=190 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Backend users</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Three users already exist. Let’s see what they
can do. The best way to do this is to logout as admin and log in as
one of these users, one at a time. All passwords are &quot;football&quot;
for now.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">&quot;christine&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_799f8c40.png" NAME="Graphic281" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=232 HEIGHT=149 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you log in as &quot;christine&quot; you will
see this when you activate the Page module for editing:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6c967067.png" NAME="Graphic282" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=231 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Only one page!! Yes, &quot;christine&quot; is
allowed to edit only one single page, the &quot;This week&quot; page.
That is her responsibility. We don't want her to tamper with anything
else - just that page. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is quite cool - she only gets to see the page
she needs to see. So not only does it reflect permission management -
it also helps make the system more intuitive and user friendly. As
you can see most of the backend modules are not shown to Christine
either. The menu to the left contains only the &quot;Page&quot; and
&quot;View&quot; modules in addition to the &quot;Help&quot; main
module which does not require special permissions.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">&quot;jonathan&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Now, log in as &quot;jonathan&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2ab4fa58.png" NAME="Graphic285" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=234 HEIGHT=156 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Jonathan is the trainer of the Youth section of
the club. So he is put in charge of the pages in relation to that!
Just like with Christine he can see only the things he should see.

<P CLASS="western">Contrary to Christine he has also been granted
access to the Filelist module: If you look what is in there you will
see a slight difference to the view you get as the &quot;admin&quot;
user:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">The root folder is not &quot;fileadmin/&quot; but
the Image Archive folder directly!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Setting up user permissions</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Now we want to know how the users &quot;jonathan&quot;
and &quot;christine&quot; have been set up! How did he do it, that
guy behind all this? Well, log in as &quot;admin&quot; again and
let’s explore it!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Try to select &quot;Edit&quot; for the two users,
&quot;jonathan&quot; and &quot;christine&quot;. You will see that
their profiles are &quot;identical&quot; in two areas: They have the
same group membership (#1) and they both have a &quot;DB mount&quot;
(#2, the starting page for their individual page trees). But jonathan
is also allowed access to the &quot;file&quot; and &quot;file_list&quot;
modules (#3) and in addition he has been assigned the file mount
&quot;Image Archive&quot; (#4). This makes sense if you think about
it since those features were the ones we noticed when we logged in as
him!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2f5c600a.png" NAME="Graphic286" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=611 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">File Mounts</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The file mount assigned to &quot;jonathan&quot; is
a relation to a simple record created in the page tree root as well:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_799f9ce0.png" NAME="Graphic287" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=63 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you edit it you will see how logically it is
configured:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_2e02b0f3.png" NAME="Graphic288" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=405 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Simply, the directory &quot;Image_Archive/&quot;
(#1) is entered as the PATH and the &quot;BASE&quot; field is
configured to interpret that path relative to the &quot;fileadmin/&quot;
directory (#2). That simple. When Jonathan has a relation set to this
record he will have this directory <I>mounted</I> in his Filelist
module!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">DB mounts</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The DB mounts (database mounts) are very easy to
understand - basically they point to the page in the whole page tree
which you want to become the root page in the page tree the user
should see! As you see it couldn't be more easy to give a specific
user access to a specific part of the page tree - just set the fields
value to that page. Or two pages even! You can add any number of &quot;DB
mounts&quot; as you like!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Page permissions</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Ahh, yeah. One note to &quot;DB mounts&quot; - if
the user has no <I>read access permission</I> to the page and sub
pages of the DB mount then it really doesn't matter whatever you have
configured - it will <I>not</I> work! And what is <I>read access</I>
then? Well, each page has a <I>permission setting for access</I> like
the file system on a UNIX server - there is an owner user, an owner
group and then permission settings for each in five different
categories; read page, edit page, delete page, new subpage and page
content. Normally the default settings are fine enough and using the
DB mounts to assign access is probably the easiest way to go. If you
run into trouble, just set all permissions to &quot;on&quot; - that
will make green stars over the full line (see image below). Of
course, if you want to really know the ins and outs of this, go to
the <A CLASS="western" HREF="http://typo3.org/doc.0.html?&amp;tx_extrepmgm_pi1[extUid]=262&amp;cHash=4f12caa011">Inside
TYPO3 document</A> - here you will get the hairy explanation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Probably the best way to show you how page
permissions should be set is to view the current permissions of the
page tree. This is done by the &quot;Access&quot; module.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you look at the ownerships of the pages you
can see that &quot;jonathan&quot; actually owns a few pages. He might
have been the creator of those.  When you create a page you become
its owner automatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western">But the main point is that the group &quot;GENERAL&quot;
is the owner group of the pages that Jonathan and Christine have
access to - and since they are both members of this group they can
access the pages alone by this fact (still they are always restricted
to work within their DB mounts!). The only thing they cannot - at
least &quot;christine&quot; since she doesn't own the &quot;This
week&quot; page - is to delete the page with a membership of the
GENERAL group. You can see that when you click one of the pencils:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_312f1ca7.png" NAME="Graphic290" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=231 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see the &quot;Delete page&quot; right
is not set for the owner group of one of those pages. You can do that
if you need Christine to delete it - but most likely she should not
be able to do so. In fact you might even restrict access further by
not allowing her to create sub pages nor edit the page title:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<H4 CLASS="western">Validation of settings</H4>
<P CLASS="western">With the module &quot;User Admin&quot; you can

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_44e01712.png" NAME="Graphic294" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=67 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The first two green stars mean &quot;Read page&quot;

edit, delete and create new pages&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">The same view for jonathan might be worth a look:</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">This clearly shows what we would expect - the file
mount and the webmounts as we experienced them earlier. Jonathan
cannot delete the main page &quot;Youth Section&quot; though.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The User Admin module is a great tool to evaluate
user settings, compare users etc. Indispensable when you have many
users and want to make sure you have control over their rights!</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Groups</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Let’s look at the GENERAL group which &quot;jonathan&quot;
and &quot;christine&quot; are both members of - what is inside it?</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1eb5adb5.png" NAME="Graphic296" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=680 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Include Access Lists&quot; is the
important point to notice here since that is the reason why we have
all these options listed! Apart from those the group can also contain
DB mounts and File mounts which will then apply to all users that are
members.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Modules</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Looking at the access lists you will see that (#1)
membership of this group will grant access to the Web, Page and List
module (unfortunately you will have to know that these codes are the
equivalents of the names you know from the menu...). 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Tables (modify)</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Secondly the tables that &quot;jonathan&quot; and
&quot;christine&quot; are allowed to edit are listed (#2). Now, can
that be true? Can they only view the pages and page content tables?
Well, let’s try and log in as &quot;jonathan&quot; again and then
try to create a new element:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7f4fd276.png" NAME="Graphic297" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=562 HEIGHT=187 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">How interesting - only pages and page content
elements could be created. No users, no guest book elements, no news
elements. Only pages and content elements. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Why this? Well, because Jonathan should <I>not</I>
worry about <I>anymore</I> than this! He is not the guy in charge of
the news, right! 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Page types</H4>
<P CLASS="western">This field (#3) dictates what page types Jonathan
and Christine - or members of GENERAL group - should be able to
select. Let’s make the &quot;Jonathan-test&quot; again and edit a
page header:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_17bf12be.png" NAME="Graphic298" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=222 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">With Jonathans login we try to create a sysFolder.
Will we succeed?</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4d4d595.png" NAME="Graphic299" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=352 HEIGHT=99 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Nope. Sorry, Jonathan. Cannot do.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Allowed Excludefields</H4>
<P CLASS="western">This is a loooong long list. But important. And
powerful! But it takes a little background to get it:</P>
<P CLASS="western">When tables and fields are configured in TYPO3 (in
the internal global PHP array, $TCA) some fields are marked as
&quot;excludeFields&quot;. This means that the fields are not allowed
to be edited unless you have been granted special permission - that
is what the &quot;Allowed Excludefields&quot; list does!</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is easy to understand if you take a look at
what &quot;jonathan&quot; sees when he edits a page header:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_a1b5dcb.png" NAME="Graphic300" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=466 HEIGHT=286 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Not an impressive amount of fields. In
particularly not if you compare it with what <I>you</I> see - the
&quot;admin&quot; user:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_79d15076.png" NAME="Graphic301" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=512 HEIGHT=516 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The reason for this difference is that 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">a) most of the fields in the pages table are
	marked as &quot;excludeFields&quot; - hence cannot be edited by
	default - and 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">b) that the GENERAL group only allows access
	to <I>some </I>of these &quot;excludeFields&quot; - according to the
	list this includes the &quot;Type&quot;, &quot;Hide page&quot;,
	&quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; fields!</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">So in fact we should be happy that Jonathan
actually <I>can </I>edit the fields &quot;Type&quot;, &quot;Hide
page&quot;, &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; since he wouldn't
have been able to do so if the GENERAL group didn't assign that
specific permission!</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Record locking?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Maybe you have noticed in the process of logging
in and out as different users that an icon like this can appear:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4e12a895.png" NAME="Graphic302" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=371 HEIGHT=63 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is just a warning to users that someone else
is working on this page at the moment - records are not truly locked
in TYPO3 since access to a record should be allowed if people have
access. But this warning is a nice touch since it helps people to
avoid conflicts.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Creating a new user for the Fan Club site</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Well, with all our brilliant knowledge we can now
create a user  who should be in charge of the second website in our
database - the Fan Club site.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Step 1: Create the user</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Users are just records - create a &quot;Backend
user&quot; record:</P>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_4b221798.png" NAME="Graphic303" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=108 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

</P>
<P CLASS="western">Save &quot;phil&quot;.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Step 2: Check the new user</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In the User Admin module, check that &quot;phil&quot;
is correctly granted access to the &quot;Fan Club&quot; site:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m620d1166.png" NAME="Graphic305" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=530 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Oops - typical error. The page permissions are not
with us here! But that is simple to change - go to the Access module:</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Step 3: Set the correct Page Permissions</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Edit the permissions for the root page of the
site:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6787da3a.png" NAME="Graphic306" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=138 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then set the owner and group and make sure the
recursive setting is selected - this will apply the changes for the
root page to subpages down to 1 level:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m7792b795.png" NAME="Graphic307" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=347 HEIGHT=284 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_7c114a91.png" NAME="Graphic308" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=345 HEIGHT=117 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Step 4: Final check</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In the &quot;User Admin&quot; module &quot;phil&quot;
checks out fine now:</P>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_46288762.png" NAME="Graphic309" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=85 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Step 5: Test the new user</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Finally log in as &quot;phil&quot;. A neat trick
is to just press the &quot;SU&quot; (Switch User) button in the User
Admin module - that logs in without the user of a password (for
&quot;admin&quot; users only of course...):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_48fd0fa5.png" NAME="Graphic310" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=63 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">And &quot;phil&quot; really checks out well - he
has access to the pages of the new website!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_3975b444.png" NAME="Graphic311" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=279 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">It's that easy.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Simple news
workflow</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Sometimes you need more than just assigning
permissions for users to edit parts of a website - you might need to
have a certain cycle in place where the job to create content is
passed on to a user who does it but cannot publish without a review
from a person responsible for the final content. Having such an
<I>approval cycle</I> is exactly what <I>workflows</I> are for. In
other cases they are just a useful way to collaborate on content
because you can <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">pass it back and
forth</SPAN> between people in a work group.</P>
<P CLASS="western">So what is this in practice? On the &quot;FC
Bigfeet&quot; site you will already find a simple workflow in place.
The workflow is designed to let a user called &quot;news&quot;
receive the task (To-Do item) to create a news-item for the website.
When he is done he sends the To-Do task back to the sender who will
review the contents and if all is OK, he will finalize the process
which means the item is automatically moved to the news archive and
possibly shown on the front page as well!</P>
<P CLASS="western">First, let’s take a look at the user called
&quot;news&quot;. Try to login as &quot;news&quot; (password
&quot;football&quot;):</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_6339218.png" NAME="Graphic312" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=185 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You have been used to see the Page module and some
other stuff - but the &quot;news&quot; user has been restricted to
see only the Task Center module! This is enough for him since he will
just have to check his Inbox of Tasks. That is empty at this point,
so he has not been assigned any tasks yet.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Starting a workflow process</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Well, logout again and return to the backend as
the &quot;admin&quot; user. You will now start a new workflow process
by assigning a To-Do task to the &quot;news&quot; user. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Create task</H4>
<P CLASS="western">So go to the Task Center module, click &quot;Tasks&quot;...</P>

<P CLASS="western">Then create a new workflow. There is only one kind
right now (you will be shown how to configure other workflows later):</P>

<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m551b805c.png" NAME="Graphic315" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=472 HEIGHT=332 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Now
you will have to fill in a form like this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Most importantly you have to select a <I>target</I>
(#1). This can be either a group or a specific user. We have selected
the user &quot;news&quot; as we planned. Then a title (#2) and
description (#4) wouldn't hurt - this is simply the job description
the target user <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">will see - to make
sure he knows</SPAN> what to do when he reads this. The deadline (#3)
will set the deadline of the task and later it will help you to keep
track of <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">which To-Do items have
passed their deadlines</SPAN> (hopefully none of course).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally you can have the system send an email (#5)
to the target user when you press the &quot;Create&quot; button -
cool, if the target user is not exactly a TYPO3 junkie logged in all
the time - then most likely sending him a mail is a good idea!
(Requires the PHP function mail() to work!)</P>
<P CLASS="western">After the creations you will be returned to your
overview of To-Do elements:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m797583ed.png" NAME="Graphic316" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=508 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;Outgoing To-Do items&quot; are the ones
you have created and which are awaiting some action from another
person. In this case the &quot;news&quot; user. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Click the title if you want to see the details:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1337210b.png" NAME="Graphic317" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=535 HEIGHT=295 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see the information is all there.
Currently no status has been assigned from the &quot;news&quot; user.
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Accepting the task</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Log in as the &quot;news&quot; user:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Tip:</B> If you start a new browser window of
Microsoft Internet Explorer from the icon on your desktop (contrary
to using CTRL+N) then you will be able to log in as another user -
the &quot;news&quot; user - and thus have two different windows
running as a user each. This is possible because Internet Explorer
doesn't share cookies between those two windows.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the Task Center the &quot;news&quot; user will
see this:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6b47e1f3.png" NAME="Graphic318" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=173 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Nice. The &quot;News&quot; task is there! Click it
in the left frame. You will now see the details as you did before as
&quot;admin&quot; user:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m1f19c1c5.png" NAME="Graphic319" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=474 HEIGHT=477 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As the &quot;news&quot; user you select &quot;Add
Status&quot; to &quot;Begin task now&quot;, then enter a status note
like &quot;OK!&quot; and press the button.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Now you will see a form for a news item appear:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_41907354.png" NAME="Graphic321" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=187 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This item has just been created for you as a part
of the &quot;Begin task now&quot; status you added. This element is
attached to the task now and all you need to do is enter the content.
When that is done and you press &quot;Save document and close&quot;
you are returned to the Task Center. Pressing the title of the To-Do
Item again allows you to see the updated details:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mb4b4b6d.png" NAME="Graphic322" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=501 HEIGHT=165 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see the element is attached here and by
clicking the edit pencil you can edit it again - until you are ready
to inform <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">the &quot;admin&quot;
user that now it is all done!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5b5b0c2f.png" NAME="Graphic323" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=422 HEIGHT=270 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">When the item is edited and ready to be published
(in your opinion) you change status to &quot;Pass on to another
user/group&quot; (this could also have been used to pass the task on
to a colleague if someone else should rather solve the task!), select
the recipient (in this case the &quot;Sender&quot;), add a note if
you find that necessary and press &quot;Send new status&quot;.</P>
<P CLASS="western">And your To-Do list is now blank, just waiting for
the next job.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Finalizing the workflow</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Back as the &quot;admin&quot; user you will see
that the To-Do task has been returned to you now:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m10045bc7.png" NAME="Graphic324" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=70 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you click the item title here you will see
the details. Click the edit pencil in order to review the content:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_56db0d7e.png" NAME="Graphic326" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=54 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m74e6e2a9.png" NAME="Graphic325" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=484 HEIGHT=391 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Apart from checking the content of the news item
(a little tame here, isn't it... ) you should also determine whether
this element is worthy of a position on the front page. That field
was not accessible to the &quot;news&quot; user - it is an
excludeField.</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you are happy with the item you activate the
final stage by selecting &quot;Finalize workflow&quot; in the &quot;Add
Status&quot; selector:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2b31b92d.png" NAME="Graphic327" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=122 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">That's it. This step finally moved the news
element to the news archive and made it online on the frontpage:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_754d9bee.png" NAME="Graphic329" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=530 HEIGHT=86 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">&quot;Done&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The last thing now is to dump the To-Do item in
the garbage bin: Simply check it &quot;Done&quot; and select the
action &quot;Delete marked To-Do items&quot;:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_76328e86.png" NAME="Graphic328" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=497 HEIGHT=118 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Configuring a workflow</H3>
<P CLASS="western">A workflow like the one we have just cycled
through is configured as a record in the page tree root. As with <I>all
records</I> in the page tree root you will have to be &quot;admin&quot;
to edit and create then:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m61f06940.png" NAME="Graphic330" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=126 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Such a record contains these fields:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_409c0f50.png" NAME="Graphic331" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=515 HEIGHT=700 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Apart from a straightforward title and description
(#1) the record first and foremost defines from which table (#2) in
TYPO3 elements should be created! This means the workflow system can
be used to control the creation process of not just pages and page
content elements or news items - but any item! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m58726209.png" NAME="Graphic332" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=183 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Obviously some tables are more interesting in this
context than others but the principle applies to it all. As you wish.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The &quot;Draft Page&quot;</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The next principle of great importance is the
&quot;Draft Page&quot; (#3). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The sysFolder &quot;News items draft page&quot; is
created as a <I>safe repository</I> where the &quot;news&quot; user
can create whatever he likes and it will harm no one. This sysFolder
works as the <I>Draft page</I>. When the &quot;news&quot; user sets
the status &quot;Begin task now&quot; the News-element attached to
the task is automatically created in this folder! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m4f215a97.png" NAME="Graphic334" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=174 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The News-item stays in this folder until the
workflow process gets finalized by the sender - then it is removed
from here and inserted on the &quot;News&quot; page - as the &quot;Move
to page when finalizing&quot; field (#6) obviously indicates.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Target groups and review users</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Between the &quot;Draft page&quot; and &quot;Final
page&quot; you will find the fields setting &quot;permissions&quot;
for the workflow. By &quot;Target groups for workflow&quot; you
specify which users can <I>receive a task</I> for creating this item.
In this case only users that are members of the &quot;News editor&quot;
group can receive the tasks.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The workflow here is a simple &quot;[Editor] -&gt;
[Author] -&gt; [Editor]&quot; workflow. In some cases you want a
third person involved. That would make the flow look like &quot;[Editor]
-&gt; [Author] -&gt; [Reviewer] -&gt; [Editor]&quot;. If that is the
case you create a relation to a reviewer user in field #5.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally the &quot;Unhide when finalizing&quot;
flag is telling the finalizing process whether to un-hide the element
if possible upon finalizing.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Did we forget something? Ahh, yes, the &quot;Groups
allowed to assign workflow&quot; field - that was not discussed. So
let’s just lean back and let the little funky &quot;?&quot; icon do
the talking:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m3934e1d0.png" NAME="Graphic333" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=370 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Just remember...</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Requirements</H3>
<P CLASS="western">In order for this workflow to work - in terms of
permissions for the &quot;news&quot; user - you will have to make
sure of a few things.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The member group</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The &quot;news&quot; user is member of the &quot;News
editor&quot; group. That group has &quot;Access Lists&quot; enabled
like the &quot;GENERAL&quot; group we already know. But the settings
are of course different:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_mc8cae00.png" NAME="Graphic336" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=413 HEIGHT=101 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As you can see (below) only the User and Task
Center modules are enabled, the News table is the only one allowed
for editing and the Allowed Excludefields are of course selected only
in relation to the News table:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m6f4c9093.png" NAME="Graphic337" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=449 HEIGHT=509 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The permissions of the Draft page</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Those must be properly set of course. In this case
- since we are creating elements on a page - we can do with this
setting (below); the &quot;News editor&quot; group as owner with
permission for creating new page content:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_m2e804580.png" NAME="Graphic320" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=521 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The DB mount</H4>
<P CLASS="western">Also - even if no page tree is available for the
&quot;news&quot; user - he needs the DB mount set: 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="1_html_5e00eb92.png" NAME="Graphic335" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=457 HEIGHT=239 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This is because TYPO3s default permission system
even checks if a page where a record is created is within the DB
mounts of the user.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Workflow To-Do</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In itself we have a little To-Do list for the
development of the workflow system in TYPO3. The most obvious need is
the ability to (re-) enter an <I>existing </I>element into a
workflow. That is still not possible. Or maybe is has become possible
in the mean time since this tutorial was written. In that case -
please remind me to remove this notice... :-)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Where to go
next?</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Well, this concludes the &quot;Getting Started&quot;
tutorial. It was probably a little more than getting started, but
that can't hurt you with TYPO3 because you will have something new to
learn every day for the next three months anyway.</P>
<P CLASS="western">First of all - all work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy - and you better go playing with TYPO3. Explore it! Click
the buttons while you can! <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Some day
you will have a production site running and then you won't want to
experiment with features you have never touched before,</SPAN>
right!? So don't hold yourself back.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Other tutorials</H4>
